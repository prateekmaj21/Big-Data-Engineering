https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio%20wave,Radio waves make up part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These waves are packets of energy with differing wavelengths similar to visible light waves Xrays or gamma rays except longer.A radio wave like other electromagnetic waves is similar to an ocean surface wave or any other type of wave.  Both types of wave have a hill and valley shape repeating over and over.  A wavelength is measured as the distance from the top of one crest to the top of its neighboring crest. While the wavelength of visible light is very very small less than one micrometer and much less than the thickness of a human hair radio waves can have a wavelength from a couple centimeters to several meters. They also have a radio frequency.The smallest radio waves are called microwaves.  Shortwaves are not quite so small.  There are also medium and long waves. Antennas designed to send and receive radio waves are usually similar in size to the wavelength they are to use. Many radio antennas like those on cars are made long because they receive signals of FM radio a few meters several feet or AM radio hundreds of meters about a thousand feet.Uses Manmade radio waves have been used since the th century for communication.  Radar was developed in the th century using radio waves to see distant objects by bouncing waves off an object and seeing how long it takes for the waves to return.  Radios also use these waves to send and receive information.Radio waves from other planets were first discovered in the s by Karl Guthe Jansky working for Bell Laboratories.  Bell was detecting noise electronics on radio channels and had Jansky try to find the source of this static or interference. After identifying noise that came from lightning he spent much time looking into the remainder. Surprisingly some of the interference was coming from space This discovery eventually led astronomers to look at radio waves along with light waves to find things in the sky. These radio astronomers use giant Radio telescopes shaped like satellite dishes to gather and study the waves.Radio waves are used for many things today.  Broadcasting and communications satellites and mobile phones and many computers communicate by radio waves.  Wave physicsRadio technologyElectromagnetic radiation

They are the product of the mixing of different cultures.The Rohingya are quite different than other people in Burma. While most people in Burma are Buddhist and speak Burmese the Rohingya are Muslim and speak the Rohingya language which is quite similar to the Bengali language spoken in the neighboring country of Bangladesh. Because of these differences a lot of people look down on the Rohingya and treat them wrong. They are worried that the Rohingya are not loyal to Burma and will try to take over the country even though Rohingya are outnumbered by other groups.The Burmese government does not like the Rohingya people. They say that the Rohingya are Bengalis and do not belong in the country. Because of this Rohingyas cannot do things that other people in Burma can such as go to school and vote.In the s the Burmese government started to put the Rohingya in concentration camps and not allow them to leave.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Smith%20%28explorer%29,John Smith c. January    June  was a English soldier explorer and author. Smith was a leader of the first settlements at the Virginia Colony in .  He explored the rivers of Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay and drew a map of the Chesapeake Bay area and New England.Smiths books and maps were very important in supporting Englishmen living in the New World.  He wrote Here every man may be master and owner of his own labour and land and if he has nothing but his hands he may still grow rich.At Jamestown Smith trained the people to farm and work so they would have food to eat.  He told them he who shall not work shall not eat.  Smiths strength of character and his determination overcame many problems including the harsh weather lack of water living in a wilderness with people who did not want to work and attacks from the Powhatan Indian tribes.Early adventuresSmith was born in January  at Willoughby Lincolnshire where his parents rented a farm. He claimed descent from the ancient Smith family of Cuerdley.Smith left home at the age of  and went to sea. He served as a soldier in the army of Henry IV of France against the Spaniards fought for Dutch revolt from the Spanish King Philip II of Spain.  He went to the  Mediterranean Sea where he worked in both trade and piracy.  He then fought against the Ottoman Empire in the Ottoman wars and for the Austrian Habsburgs in Kingdom of Hungary in  and .Smith is reputed to have defeated killed and beheaded Turkish commanders in  duels. He was knighted by the Transylvanian Prince and was given a horse and coat of arms showing  Turks heads. In  he was wounded in a skirmish captured and sold as a slave. Smith wrote that his Turkish master sent him as a gift to his Greek mistress in Constantinople who fell in love with Smith. He then escaped from the Ottoman lands and returned to England in .In Jamestown In  the Smith was hired by the Virginia Company to settle in Virginia Colony for profit. They set sail in three ships in December . Smith had a servant named Samuel Collier. Samuel Collier would stay by him most of the way through. There were problems on the voyage and Smith was charged with mutiny. Captain Newport planned to execute him.  The Captain opened a letter of orders from the Virginia Company which stated that Smith was to be one of the leaders of the new colony so Smith was not killed.refA True Relation of Such Occurrences and Accidents of Note as Happened in Virginia  EText University of VirginiarefThe English arrived in April  and Captain Wingfield chose Jamestown to be the location for the colony.  In summer the settlers were still living in temporary housing.  After the fourmonth ocean trip food supplies were only enough for each person to have a cup or two of grainmeal per day. Due to the weather and lack of food disease spread through the people and by September more than half died.In December  Smith was looking for food and was captured by Native Americans.  He was taken to meet the Chief of the Powhatan tribe.  The village was about  miles from Jamestown. Smith was released without harm and gave credit in part to the chiefs daughter Pocahontas who threw herself across his body. Seeing this her father took mercy on Smith and he was safely taken back to Jamestown.  This encounter began a friendly relationship between the natives Smith and the colonists at Jamestown.In early January  nearly  new settlers arrived with Captain Newport and through carelessness the village was set on fire.  That winter the James River froze over and the settlers were forced to live in the ruins.  During this time Newport and his crew wasted much time loading their ships with iron pyrite fools gold.  Food supplies ran low and although the Native Americans brought some food Smith wrote that more than half of us died.  In April  a ship brought supplies and  new settlers whom Smith set to build housing and to plant crops.In the summer of  Smith left Jamestown to explore the Chesapeake Bay region and search for badly needed food.  He made a map that would be of great value to Virginia explorers for over a century. In his absence Smith left his friend Matthew Scrivener as governor in his place. Scrivener would later drown in a storm in an illfated voyage to Hog Island. Smith was elected president of the local council in September  and instituted strict rules. In October  a ship arrived with  new settlers including the first women. Some German and Polish craftsmen also arrived but they brought no food supplies.  After that Smith tried to get food from the Native Americans and it took threats of military force for them to obey. Powhatan was frightened by the great number of white men coming into the area and was trying to starve them.Smith found that there were those among both the settlers and Native Americans who did not like his rules and were planning to kill him.  Smith wrote that he was warned by Pocahontas. He called a meeting and told the men who did not work that he that will not work shall not eat After that the situation improved.For three months in early  February March and April all was well at Jamestown with many dwellings built acres of land cleared and much other work done. Then in April rats and dampness destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or they would have to leave the safety of the fort.  Some left and went to the Native American villages but Powhatans people also went by Smiths law that he who works not eats not.  This was in effect until they were near starved and they returned home.   At some point an unexpected ship arrived captained by Samuel Argall. He had food and wine which Smith bought with a promise to pay back. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company was sending more supplies and settlers to Jamestown along with a new governor Lord De la Warr.In a May  voyage to Virginia Sir Thomas Smith Virginia Company treasurer arranged for about  colonists including women and children to come along. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbor.  The Sea Venture was shipwrecked on the Bermuda islands with the admiral and Stephen Hopkins on board.  One year later in May  they had arrived at Jamestown in small boats they had made.  Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area they met a ship carrying the new governor Lord De la Warr who ordered them back to Jamestown.In August  John Smith was quite surprised to see more than  new settlers arrive. London was sending new settlers with no planning as to how or where they would live.Capt. John Smith was severely injured by an accidental gunpowder explosion in his canoe.  Smith sailed to England for treatment in October .  He had spent two and a half years trying to do his best for Jamestown. He never returned to Virginia. History has confirmed his great contribution at Jamestown in its earliest years.Colonists would continue to die from various illnesses and disease with an estimated  of the  surviving that winter.  In spite of this the Virginia Company continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown. For the next five years Governors Gates and Sir Thomas Dale continued to keep strict discipline with Sir Thomas Smith in London attempting to find skilled craftsmen and other settlers to send to Jamestown. Later yearsIn  Smith returned to the northeast coast of America and named the region New England. In that same year a storm destroyed his ship. In  Smith was captured by French pirates off the coast of the Azore Islands.  He escaped after weeks of captivity and made his way back to England where he wrote an account of his two voyages as A Description of New England. He never left England again. He died in the year  in London at the age of .  He is buried in the church of St SepulchrewithoutNewgate in the City of London.The Captain John Smith Monument currently lies off the coast of New Hampshire on Star Island part of the Isles of Shoals. Built in  to honor the th anniversary of John Smiths visit to what he named Smiths Isles.In  the New Hampshire Society of Colonial Wars partially restored and rededicated the monument for the th anniversary celebration of his historic visit.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax,Pneumothorax sometimes called collapsed lung is a health problem where air or gas is in the pleural space the space between the lung and the pleura. The pleura is a slim membrane that covers the lungs. The two parts of the pleura usually touch. A hole might grow in the surface of the lung. Air then enters between the pleura and the lung. The lung will collapse. If enough air gets into the pleural space it can also push against other organs or parts in the chest like the heart or the aorta. Pneumothorax is a medical emergency.There are two main types of pneumothorax. These are a Closed Pneumothorax and an Open Pneumothorax. These are also known as Simple Pneumothorax and Complex Pneumothorax.Symptoms The most common symptoms of Pneumothorax are chest pains. The chest pains can be sharp dull or stabbing. Some other symptoms of Pneumothorax are shortness of breath rapid breathing and coughing.Causes A Pneumothorax can occur for no obvious reason spontaneous. It is typically  men who are tall or perhaps have long torsos between the ages of  and  who present a spontaneous pneumothorax.Small air blisters blebs can develop on the top of the surface of the lungs. These blebs sometimes burst  allowing air to leak into the pleural space that surrounds the lungs causing the lung to collapse.Otherwise it can be caused by blunt or penetrating injuries or lung diseases that result in the lung leaking air into the pleural cavity.Consuming cannabis via smoking is also related to victims of a pneumothorax.TreatmentSimple Pneumothorax will heal by itself. Complex pneumothorax will need medical attention. One should treat respiratory problems as soon as they occur.Closed pneumothorax Closed pneumothorax is when air or gas gets in the pleural space without any outside wound. This sometimes happens when the lung is already injured somehow like from diseases such as cancer or cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a disease in the lungs. Glands in the body make large amounts of thick mucus. The mucus blocks ducts and passageways.The most common cause of closed pneumothorax is called spontaneous pneumothorax. The cause of spontaneous pneumothorax is not known.Open pneumothorax Open pneumothorax is when air gets into the pleural space from an injury to the chest. This can happen with stab wounds like from a knife. It can also happen after a gunshot injury. The injury is most dangerous if the wound lets air in when the injured person or animal breathes but does not let it back out. Sometimes this is called a sucking chest wound.References Respiratory system

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal%20energy,Tidal energy sometimes called tidal power is using the energy contained in the nature of islam in tides and open ocean currents for hydroelectricity. Tidal energy systems can extract either kinetic energy energy caused by movement from the moving water of rivers tides and open ocean currents or potential energy from the difference in height or head between high and low tides.  The first method  generating energy from tidal currents  is becoming more popular because people believe that it does not harm the environment as much as barrages or dams. Many coastal sites worldwide are being examined to see if they can be used to produce tidal current energy. Like other hydroelectricity electricity made using water tidal power produces lots ofpollution and is not a renewable energy source because tides are caused by events that happen in the solar system and so will not run out. Tidal power has great potential for future power and electricity generation because of the very large amount of energy contained in these rotational systems. Tidal power is reliably predictable unlike wind power and solar power. In Europe tide mills have been used for nearly  years mainly for grinding grains.  Modern tide mills provide tidal stream power.Many things affect tides.  The pull of the Moon is the largest effect and most of the energy comes from the slowing of the Earths spin.Sources  Baker A.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejanus,Sejanus Lucius Aelius Seianus  BC  October  AD  was an ambitious soldier friend and confidant of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. An equestrian by birth Sejanus rose to power as Praetorian Prefect. He commanded the Roman imperial bodyguard the Praetorian Guard from AD  until his death in .After the Praetorian Guard was established under Augustus Sejanus introduced reforms which saw the unit go from a mere bodyguard to an influential branch of the government. It controlled public security and influenced civil administration. Most important of all it influenced the succession of emperors all needed the goodwill and support of the Guard. These changes would have a lasting impact on the Empire.During the s Sejanus gradually accumulated power by influencing Tiberius and eliminating potential political opponents including the emperors son Drusus. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in  Sejanus was left in control of the entire state mechanism as de facto ruler of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome Sejanus suddenly fell from power in  the year his career culminated with the consulship. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against Tiberius Sejanus was arrested and executed along with his followers.Sejanus as tyrant In  Sejanus began a series of purge trials of senators and rich equestrians in the city removing those capable of opposing his power adding to the imperial and his own treasury. Networks of spies and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of treason and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed. Only Caligula the last remaining son of Germanicus managed to survive the purges of Sejanus. He had moved to Capri to be with Tiberius in .Downfall Through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor Sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire. Exactly what caused his sudden downfall is unclear According to Josephus it was Antonia the mother of Livilla who finally alerted Tiberius to the growing threat Sejanus posed. She sent a letter to Capri in the care of her freedman Pallas.By the end of  he would be arrested summarily executed. His body unceremoniously cast down the Gemonian stairs which were a flight of steps in the ancient city of Rome. Nicknamed the Stairs of Mourning they are infamous in Roman history as a place of execution. It was done like this. Tiberius resigned his post of Consul which forced Sejanus to do likewise. This removed much of Sejanus legal powers and protection. Another man Macro was appointed as Praetorian Prefect. Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution. Following an issue of damnatio memoriae by the Senate his statues were torn down and his name obliterated from public records. Although Rome at first rejoiced at the death of Sejanus the city quickly plunged into more extensive trials as Tiberius relentlessly persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. This included all the children of Sejanus.References Roman people

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers%20to%20entry,In economics barriers to entry also known as barrier to entry refers to the things that makes it difficult for a firm or a person to enter a market. These are called obstacles and makes it harder for a firm or a person to enter a market. Examples of barriers to entry include government regulation for firms and the need for a certain level of education for a person.Barriers to entry helps to protect existing firms in the market from new firms entering a market and thus reduces competition in the market which causes prices to be higher than what is accepted by society. Monopolies and market power is thus formed due to the existence of barriers to entry.Definition While the general definition of barriers to entry refers to the obstacles that makes it difficult for a firm or a person to enter a market there are certain differences in the definitions given by economists as given below. George Stigler defined barriers to entry as A cost of producing which must be borne by a firm which seeks to enter an industry but is not borne by firms already in the industry. Franklin M. Fisher defined it as anything that prevents entry when entry is socially beneficial. Joe S. Bain defined its as anything that allows incumbent firms to earn supernormal profits without threat of entry.References Economics
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas%20Sankara,Thomas Isidore Nol Sankara  born  December    October  was a Burkinab revolutionary. He was  President of Burkina Faso from  to . He was a  Marxist and panAfricanist. His supporters viewed him as  a charismatic and iconic figure of revolution. For this reason he  is sometimes called  Africas Che Guevara.Career There was a coup in  supported by the people. A number of revolutionaries seized power for Sankara who was under house arrest at the time. Aged  Sankara became the President of the Republic of Upper Volta. He immediately launched programmes for social ecological and economic change and renamed the country from the French colonial name Upper Volta to Burkina Faso Land of Incorruptible People with its people being called Burkinab upright people. His foreign policies were centred on antiimperialism with his government refusing all foreign aid pushing for odious debt reduction nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian selfsufficiency and land reform prioritising education with a nationwide literacy campaign and promoting public health by vaccinating . million children against meningitis yellow fever and measles.His national agenda also included planting over  million trees to combat the growing desertification of the Sahel redistributing land from feudal landlords to peasants suspending rural poll taxes and domestic rents and establishing a road and railway construction programme. On the local level Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had over  communities build schools with their own labour. Moreover he made female genital mutilation forced marriages and polygamy illegal. He appointed women to high governmental positions and encouraged them to work outside the home and stay in school even if pregnant. Sankara encouraged the prosecution of officials accused of corruption counterrevolutionaries and lazy workers in Popular Revolutionary Tribunals. As an admirer of the Cuban Revolution Sankara set up Cubanstyle Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.His revolutionary programmes for African selfreliance made him an icon to many of Africas poor. Sankara remained popular with most of his countrys citizens. However his policies alienated and antagonised several groups which included the small but powerful Burkinab middle class the tribal leaders who were stripped of their longheld traditional privileges of forced labour and tribute payments and the governments of France and its ally the Ivory Coast.Death On  October  Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise Compaor who assumed leadership of the state shortly after having Sankara killed. A week before his assassination Sankara declared While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered you cannot kill ideas.References  births deathsPrime Ministers of Burkina FasoPanAfricanists

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s%20Last%20Theorem,Fermats Last Theorem is a very famous idea in mathematics. It says that If  is a whole number larger than  then the equation  has no solutions when x y and z are natural numbers.This means that there are no examples where   and  are natural numbers i.e. whole numbers larger than zero and where  is a whole number bigger than . Pierre de Fermat wrote about it in  inside his copy of a book called Arithmetica. He said I have a proof of this theorem but there is not enough space in this margin. However no correct proof was found for  years. It was finally proven in . Mathematicians everywhere think that Fermat in fact did not have a good proof of this theorem.Overview Fermats Last Theorem is a more general form of the Pythagorean theorem which is an equation that says When   and  are whole numbers this is called a Pythagorean triple. For example  and since  we can say  is a Pythagorean triple. Fermats Last Theorem rewrites this as and claims that if you make the  a larger whole number than  then   and  cannot all be natural numbers. For example  and  and so  is an example that confirms this.Proof The proof was made for some values of  such as    and  which was managed by many mathematicians including Fermat Euler Sophie Germain. However since there are an infinite number of Pythagorean triples as numbers count upwards forever this made Fermats Last Theorem hard to prove or disprove the full proof must show that the equation has no solution for all values of  when  is a whole number bigger than  but it is not possible to simply check every combination of numbers if they continue forever.An English mathematician named Andrew Wiles found a solution in   years after Fermat wrote about it. Richard Taylor helped him find the solution . The proof took eight years of research. He proved the theorem by first proving the modularity theorem which was then called the TaniyamaShimura conjecture. Using Ribets Theorem he was able to give a proof for Fermats Last Theorem.  He received the Wolfskehl Prize from Gttingen Academy in June  it amounted to about  U.S. dollars.After a few years of debate people agreed that Andrew Wiles had solved the problem. Andrew Wiles used a lot of modern mathematics and even created new maths when he made his solution. This mathematics was unknown when Fermat wrote his famous note so Fermat could not have used it. This leads one to believe that Fermat did not in fact have a complete solution of the problem.ReferencesMore readingOther websites Theorems in number theory

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol,Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is the chemical or drug made in the cannabis that causes a person to feel different. It is similar to at least  other chemicals in cannabis known as cannabinoids but not all of them will make you feel different or high after using it. There are about  chemicals in cannabis total. THC is a very fatty chemical and doesnt interact with water very well. THC is thought to be used by the plant for protection from bugs light and other harm from its environment. The THC chemical structure was discovered in  by Dr. Raphael Mechoulam and Dr. Y. Gaoni at the Weizmann Institute in Israel.Use in medicine THC is used in medicine as a treatment for many physical and psychological problems. It can be used to help people with pain or are sick from getting chemotherapy for cancer. There are some medications which have THC and can be ordered by a doctor depending on where and what country you live in.Pharmacological Effects Cannabis works by sticking to special receptors in the brain and body which is known as the endocannabinoid system or ECS. There are  kinds of receptors CB and CB. Over time a person will need more THC to feel the same effects as before. This is known as tolerance. A person may also experience withdrawal which can be uncomfortable and is a result of stopping THC use quickly after using it for some time. People usually do not get addicted to using THC.THC in the body THC is very fatty fat soluble and binds to fat cells in our body and causes it to leave the body slowly even if the effects of the drug or high has already ended. The amount still in the body depends on how often THC is used. The minimum time for a person to pass a drug test would be about  week. It is not possible for humans or animals to realistically die from taking too much THC or marijuana and no person has ever died from it.Legality Many places in the world do not see THC or cannabis as legal and can have very harsh penalties from having producing or using it. Some countries allow it for use only in medical treatment while others allow it for recreational use by adults usually older than  or  years old. Children may be permitted to use it if theyre very sick.In North America Canada and Mexico have taken action to allow marijuana use in some way. In the United States the federal government sees marijuana as illegal and very addictive and cannot be used as a medicine. Individual states with in the U.S.A. allows people to use marijuana to help with sickness or recreationally.Drug Testing Employers or people who work in a government agency like the police or FBI may test someone to see if they used any drugs recently. This is called a drug test. Police may do this if they think you have used marijuana before or while you are driving a car. THC lasts a long time in the body and can be found in body fluids like urine or saliva or hair and sweat. Since it lasts so long in the body it can be a problem being sure if someone is high.References CannabisOrganic compounds

In the s he lived in exile in Europe with Charles II of England. When Charles II was put back on the British throne during the restoration in  Ormonde became very important in English and Irish politics.Early lifeThe Butlers of Ormonde were an Old English dynasty. They had been very important people the southeast of Ireland since the Middle Ages. His father was Thomas Butler Viscount Thurles. Thurles is a place in County Tipperary. James was the oldest son. His father died in  when he was  years old. He became Viscount Thurles. His mother took him to England where his grandfather Walter Butler th Earl of Ormond made him go to a Catholic school. James I was King at the time. James I was a Protestant and wanted to make sure that James would also be a Protestant. This would give him power in Ireland once James Butler went back to Thurles. James I placed James Butler under the care of archbishop George Abbot. When he was fifteen he went to live with his grandfather at Drurylane. It became very important in his life that he was a Protestant. Almost all his relatives were Catholics. This made his family not like him very much. They had land and possessions taken from them and they were not treated fairly because they were Catholics. This did not happen to James.In December  he married Lady Elizabeth Preston. In  on the death of his grandfather he became Earl of Ormonde.Rebellion and Civil WarIn  Thomas Wentworth st Earl of Strafford became head of government in Ireland. He liked Ormonde. He wrote to Charles I saying that Ormonde was young but take it from me a very staid head. Ormonde became Wentworths friend and supporter. Wentworth planned to take land from the Catholics in Ireland. He did this to get money for the British king. He also wanted to break the political power of the Irish Catholic gentry. Ormonde supported this plan. The plans made his relatives very angry and many of them opposed Wentworth. This led to armed rebellion. The opposition to Wentworth helped an impeachment of the Earl by the English Parliament. He was executed in May . When the Irish Rebellion of  started Ormonde was in command of government troops based in Dublin. Most of the country was taken by the Catholic rebels who included Ormondes Butler relatives. Rebel leader Richard Butler rd Viscount Mountgarret was Ormondes cousin. In spring  Mountgarret and Ormonde were the commanders of the two sides at the battle of Kilrush with Ormondes side winning.In spring  the Irish Catholics formed their own government the Catholic Confederation. The capital was Kilkenny. They started to organise their own troops. Also in early  the king sent in troops from England and Scotland to help with the fight. The Irish Confederate War had started. Ormonde cleared the area around Dublin of Confederate forces. He got control of the area historically known as the Pale. In March  Ormonde brought his troops to New Ross. This was deep in the territory of the Catholic Confederation. He won a small victory there Battle of New Ross before returning to Dublin. However Ormonde was in a very difficult situation. The Confederates held two thirds of the island. The English Civil War had started in September . This meant that there were not going to be more troops from England to help him. The King had even asked to send back the troops he had sent before.Isolated in Dublin Ormonde agreed to a ceasefire to stop fighting with the Catholics which began in September . The greater part of Ireland was given up into the hands of the Catholic Confederation. This left only districts in the north the Dublin Pale round Cork City and certain smallish garrisons in the possession of Protestant commanders. This truce was strongly opposed by the Lords Justices and the Protestant community in general in Ireland.In November  the king appointed Ormonde as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. This was the highest post in the Irish government. Ormonde was told to stop the kings Parliamentarian enemies being helped from Ireland. He also had to deliver more troops to fight for the Royalist side in England. He was also given the kings authority to make peace with the Catholic Confederation. They could then allow their troops to fight against the Parliamentarians.Negotiations with the Irish ConfederatesOrmonde had a difficult job to do. The Old native Irish and Catholic Irish of English descent the Old English had their own government in Confederate Ireland. They would support King Charles I of England if he would allow them freedom to be Catholics and give them selfgovernment. On the other side any deals he made with Catholic Confederates meant that his support among English and Scottish Protestants in Ireland would become less. On August   Edward Somerset nd Marquess of Worcester acting on behalf of King Charles signed a treaty peace agreement in Kilkenny with the Irish Catholic Confederates. He did not talk about this with the Irish Protestant community. Irish Protestants were strongly against this and Charles was forced to undo the treaty almost immediately. He was afraid that almost all Irish Protestant would give support to the other side in the English Civil War. On March   Ormonde on behalf of the king signed another treaty with the Confederates. This one gave them religious and other rights. However the Confederates General Assembly their government in Kilkenny did not like the deal. This was in part because of what the popes ambassador nuncio Giovanni Battista Rinuccini said. He did not want the Catholics to compromise. The Confederates arrested those among them who had signed the treaty with Ormonde.Ormonde then judged that he could not keep the Confederates out of Dublin. He asked for help from English Long Parliament and signed an agreement with them on June  . At the beginning of August Ormonde handed over Dublin together with  royalist troops under his command to the Parliamentarian commander Michael Jones. He had arrived from England with  Parliamentarian troops. Ormonde in turn sailed to England. He said about his surrender that he preferred English rebels to Irish ones. The royalist and parliamentarian troops were fighting on different sides in the English Civil War. But in Ireland they fought together against the Catholic Confederates. The combined troops won a major battle against the Confederates soon afterward near Dublin Battle of Dungans Hill.Commander of Royalist AllianceIn March  he joined the queen and the Prince of Wales in Paris. In September he went back to Ireland. He was going to try to get the Irish Confederates and the Irish Protestants to support the king now that the popes nuncio was gone. The Irish Confederates wanted to make a compromise now. Their battle against the English Parliamentarian forces was not going well. On  January  Ormonde signed a peace with the rebels which said that they could practice their religion freely.After Charles I was executed in  he stated Irelands support for Charles II. Ormonde was put in command of the Irish Confederates armies and also the English Royalist troops who had come to Ireland. Almost all of Ireland was under his control before August . Yet Ormonde was not able to stop the conquest of Ireland by Oliver Cromwell in . Most of the English and Protestant Royalist troops left Ormondes side and went to fight for Cromwell in May . The Irish Catholic troops were the only ones left under his command. They did not trust him. Ormonde was made to leave his command in late . He returned to France later that year. In Cromwells Act of Settlement  all of Ormondes lands in Ireland were taken from him.Ormonde was great friends with Charles II and the queen mother in Paris. He went to Aix and Cologne with Charles when he had to leave France. He played an active part in the secret planning of the Restoration the plan to put Charles II back on the throne of England..Ormondes career after Charles II became KingAfter Charles II became king Ormonde got a lot of different responsibilities and titles from the king. He was made commissioner for the treasury and the navy Lord Steward of the Household a Privy Councillor Lord Lieutenant of Somerset High Steward of Westminster Kingston and Bristol chancellor of Trinity College Dublin Baron Butler of Llanthony and Earl of Brecknock in the peerage of England Duke of Ormonde in the Irish peerage Lord High Steward of England for Charless coronation that year.He also got back his lands in Ireland.  On  November  he became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland again. He did not like it when Charles II stopped importing cattle from Ireland. In return he stopped importing cattle from Scotland.In March  Ormonde was removed from the government of Ireland. He did not mind. He made sure that his sons and others that listened to him stayed in their posts. He was chosen as Chancellor of the University of Oxford on  August .In  an attempt was made to kill the duke by an adventurer named Thomas Blood. Ormonde was attacked by Blood and his helpers while driving up St Jamess Street on the night of  December . He was pulled out of his carriage and taken on horseback along Piccadilly. They wanted to hang him at Tyburn. Ormonde managed to escape.In  the king decided that he would become the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland once again. On his arrival in Ireland he set up a tax system and reorganised the army. After the Popish Plot  in England Ormonde at once took action that would make Roman Catholics powerless. There were far more Catholics than Protestants in the country  Catholics for every  Protestant. In  he went back to London at the request of the King who he supported. The last thing he did as lord lieutenant was to declare Irish support for James II of England after the death of Charles II. Ormonde lived in retirement at Cornbury in Oxfordshire. Ormonde died on  July  at Kingston Lacy Dorset. Ormonde was buried in Westminster Abbey on  August .ReferencesFurther readingThomas Carte Life of the Duke of Ormonde  vols.  new ed. in  vols.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library%20of%20Celsus,The Library of Celsus is an ancient Roman building in Ephesus now part of Anatolia Turkey. It was built in honor of the Roman Senator Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus known as Celsus.Celsus paid for the construction of the library with his own personal wealth. Celsus was Consul in AD Governor of the Roman province of Asia in AD and a rich and popular local citizen. He was a native of nearby Sardis and amongst the first Greek men to become a consul in the Roman Empire. He is honoured both as a Greek and a Roman on the library itself.The library was built by his son Gaius Julius Aquila Consul AD and completed in AD.The library was built to store  scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus. Celsus is buried in a sarcophagus beneath the library in the main entrance. which is both a crypt containing his sarcophagus and a sepulchral monument to him. It was unusual to be buried within a library or even within city limits so this was a special honour for Celsus.HistoryThe library was built in Ephesus a Greek city in Asia Minor.The building is important as one of few remaining examples of an ancient Romaninfluenced library. It also shows that public libraries were built not only in Rome itself but throughout the Roman Empire.The interior of the library and all its books were destroyed by fire in the devastating earthquake that struck the city in . Only the facade survived. About AD the library was used for other purposes. The facade was completely destroyed by a later earthquake likely in the late Byzantine period.In the s and s the facade was restored. It now serves as a prime example of Roman public architecture. The building had a single hall which faced east toward the morning sun as Vitruvius advised to benefit early risers. Beside the entrances are four pairs of Ionic columns on pedestals.  A set of Corinthian columns stands directly above the first set adding to the height of the building. It is thought there once may have been a third set of columns.This type of facade with inset frames and niches for statues is like that found in ancient Greek theatres  and so is described as scenographic.References Libraries in AsiaAncient RomeAncient GreeceBuildings and structures in TurkeyWorld Heritage Sites in Turkey

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa%20with%20the%20Head%20of%20Perseus,Medusa with the Head of Perseus is a sculpture.  Argentine artist Luciano Garbati made it in .  It is famous because people in the Me Too movement talked about it.  The media called the statue an icon of justice for people who survived sexual assault. That happened several years after the statue was made.MythMedusa is a Greek myth.  In the story Perseus kills Medusa not the other way around Medusa is a monster with a face so terrible that anyone who sees her turns to stone.  Medusa lives on an island.  The hero Perseus comes to the island to kill Medusa.  He cuts off her head and puts it in a bag.  He later uses the head to turn his enemies to stone.  Perseus then gives Medusas dead head to the gods.  Zeus puts Medusas head on his shield so it will frighten his enemies.At some point in history no later than the Roman poet Ovid another part was added to the myth Medusa starts as a human priestess and not a monster.  She works for the goddess Athena in her temple.  She is raped by the god Poseidon in Athenas temple.  To the people telling the myth Medusa not Poseidon was the one who had done something bad.  Athena punishes Medusa by turning her into an ugly monster Her hair turns into snakes.  Her face becomes terrifying.  Only then does Medusa go to the island where Perseus will later kill her.MakingIn the s Benvenuto Cellini made a sculpture called Perseus with the Head of Medusa. In that sculpture a nearly naked Perseus holds up Medusas head.  Garbati wanted to make that statue in reverse.  Garbati did not think he was making feminist art.  He only want to flip the script of the story of Perseus and Medusa.  He only wanted to show the sculpture the opposite way.Garbati started with clay.  He used the clay model to make another sculpture out of resin and fiberglass.  Then he could use the resin sculpture to make copies out of bronze.  The sculpture is almost  feet tall about  meters.  It shows a naked Medusa with a sword in her left hand.  She holds a mans head by the hair in her right hand.  She stares down and ahead.  She looks like a woman and not a monster.  Garbati used his own face for Perseus.Garbati offered to sell the original resin sculpture for US and bronze copies for US depending on who made the bronze copy.Garbati decided not to copy Cellinis statue exactly.  Cellini shows Perseus holding Medusas head high and smiling.  He stands lightly on one foot.  Garbati shows Medusa holding Perseus head low and staring straight ahead.  She stands heavily on both feet.  Garbati said this was because Perseus coming to attack Medusa meant different things to Perseus and MedusaI was thinking of Perseus this man with all his gadgets going there and having this victory. This difference between a masculine victory and a feminine one that was central to my work. The representations of Perseus hes always showing the fact that he won showing the headif you look at my Medusasshe is determined she had to do what she did because she was defending herself. Its quite a tragic moment.As survivor iconDuring the MeToo Movement thousands of women wrote to Garbati saying what the statue meant to them.  They said Medusa was a woman who had been raped who fought back.CriticismSome people said that black women started the MeToo Movement so it was not good to have a statue made by a male artist as its symbol.  Garbati answered that he liked that people liked his statue.  He also said hed learned more about patriarchy.  Other people asked Garbati why he made Medusa naked and beautiful when she is ugly in the myth.  He answered that artists have been showing Medusa as beautiful since the s b.c.e.  Other people asked why Medusa was holding the head of Perseus and not of the god who raped her Poseidon.  This was because Garbati had not meant to make the statue about rape survivors.  He had only meant to do Cellinis statue backwards.LocationFor a long time the statue stayed in Garbatis own art studio in Buenos Aires.In  the statue was shown in New Yorks Collect Pond Park near the court of criminal justice.  This was where Harvey Weinstein stood trial for his crimes.  Garbati and helpers started selling small copies of the statue.  They gave  of the money to the National Womens Law Center.ReferencesOther websitesOfficial websiteMedusa with the Head ProjectArtStatuesFeminism

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots,Mary Queen of Scots  December    February  was Queen of Scotland from  December  until  July  when she was forced to give up her kingdom abdicate. She was executed because it was said she had been  plotting to kill her cousin Elizabeth I of England.Early life Mary was the daughter of King James V of Scotland who died just after she was born. She was crowned queen when she was only  days old. She went to live in France when she was very young. Scotland would be ruled by regents until she was  years old. The first regent was the Earl of Arran. After  the regent was Marys mother Mary of Guise.King Henry VIII of England tried to get Lord Arran to agree that Mary would marry his son. This led to a series of battles called the Rough Wooing. In the end Lord Arran turned to the French for help. Lord Arran and King Henry II of France agreed that France would protect Scotland if Mary could marry the Kings son Francis. When she was  years old Mary married Francis who was now King Francis II of France. But their marriage was short. Francis became very ill and later died from an ear infection that had spread to his brain leaving Mary a widow shortly before her th birthday.When Mary was born Scotland was a Catholic country. While she was living in France Protestant ideas were spreading to Scotland. Her mother tried to stop this but could not. In  the Parliament of Scotland said it wanted Scotland to be a Protestant country.Reign in Scotland In  Mary returned to Scotland. She found that she was not popular in her kingdom. She had been brought up as a Catholic but many people in Scotland had become Protestant. It was difficult for Mary to avoid siding with either the Catholics or the Protestants. As Mary was now free to marry again there were lots of noblemen who wanted to become her husband. For her second husband she chose an English lord named Henry Stuart Lord Darnley who was of royal blood. Darnley was goodlooking and charming but he was often very childish and he was jealous of Marys secretary an Italian named David Rizzio.Mary became pregnant. While she was expecting the baby Darnley and his friends got drunk one night and decided to kill David Rizzio. They came into Marys private rooms at Holyrood Palace while she was talking with Rizzio and they stabbed him to death. Darnley got away with the murder because he was the queens husband but Mary never forgave him for murdering her friend Rizzio and avoided being with him again. When her baby was born it was a boy who would later become King James VI of Scotland.In  Darnley was murdered. James Hepburn th Earl of Bothwell was put on trial for the murder but found not guilty. He was a powerful Scottish nobleman who was loyal to Mary and hated Darnley. Mary then married him. This caused her problems because Bothwell had many enemies and many still believed he had murdered Darnley. Marys enemies forced her off the throne and made her young son king in her place. Mary was put in prison in Loch Leven Castle. She escaped and crossed the border into England which was ruled by her cousin Elizabeth Queen of England.Imprisonment and execution Mary hoped that Elizabeth would help her to get her throne back but Elizabeth did not since it was always believed that Mary would try to take the throne from her. She kept Mary a prisoner for many years. Mary was eventually accused of making plans to murder Elizabeth. A jury of thirty noblemen convicted her of treason and she was executed.Even though Elizabeth signed the death warrant she put it off for a long time as she was not comfortable with executing someone who was both a family member and another queen.References births deathsHouse of StuartKings and Queens of Scotland

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor,The Holodomor  which means murder by hunger was a manmade famine that happened in Ukraine in  and in . At that time Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union. About seven million people starved to death in the Holodomor.Joseph Stalin was the leader and dictator of the Soviet Union which was a communist country. He made farmers in the Soviet Union change the way they farmed then he tried to make the farmers work harder for the governmentowned farms for less money. Many people in the Ukraine did not want to go along with this. When the Ukraine had a famine Stalin refused to help the people in the Ukraine. Instead the government took food away from people. It became illegal against the law to pick up food from the ground of fields. The government also tried to stop people from moving around the country to look for food.Scholars and politicians using the word Holodomor say the manmade aspects of the famine was  a genocide some consider the huge loss of life comparable to the Holocaust. They argue that the Soviet policies were an attack on the rise of Ukrainian nationalism and therefore is a genocide.Other scholars say that the Holodomor was an unexpected consequence of the rapid and massive industrialization started by Stalin that brought radical economic changes to the farmers and the country and which was not done on purpose.Images of Holodomor victimsImages of Holodomor memorialsOther websites  Ukrainian Genocide Famine Foundation USA   Famine Genocide Commemorative Committee Ukrainian Canadian Congress  Findings of the Commission on the Ukraine Famine  U.S. Commission on the Ukraine Famine Report to Congress.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/History%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church,The history of the Catholic Church is the formation events and change of the Catholic Church through time.The Catholic Church began with Jesus Christ and his teachings. It is a continuation of the early Christian community established by the Disciples of Jesus. The Church believes its bishops to be the successors to Jesuss apostles and the Churchs leader the Bishop of Rome also known as the Pope to be the only successor to Saint Peter who ministered in Rome in the first century AD after his appointment by Jesus as head of the Church.Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire with all persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. In  the persecutions were lessened by the Edict of Milan with the legalization of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine I. In  under Emperor Theodosius Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire by the Edict of Thessalonica.The battles of Toulouse preserved the Christian west against the Umayyad Muslim army even though Rome itself was destroyed in  and Constantinople attacked. In the th century already difficult relations between the mostly Greek church in the East and the Latin church in the West developed into the EastWest Schism partially due to conflicts over the Popes authority. Before and during the th century the Church started a process of reform and renewal. Reform during the th century is known as the CounterReformation. In later centuries Catholicism spread widely across the world even though it experienced a reduction of European believers due to the growth of Protestantism and also because of religious doubt and distrust during and after the Enlightenment. The Second Vatican Council in the s introduced the most big changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent four centuries before.Church beginningsOriginsEarly organization According to Catholic tradition the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ. The New Testament narrates about Jesus activities teaching his appointment of the twelve Apostles and his instructions to them to continue his work. The Catholic Church teaches that Pentocost signaled the beginning of the public ministry of the Church. In this event the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles.According to the Catholic Church Christ desginated Peter as the rock upon which he would build his church. Catholics hold that Saint Peter was Romes first bishop. He started the unbroken line which includes the current pontiff Pope Francis. That is the Catholic Church maintains the apostolic succession of the Bishop of Rome the Pope who is the successor to Saint Peter.Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empires network of roads and waterways allowed easier travel. Also the Pax Romana made it safe to travel from one region to another. The government had encouraged inhabitants to learn Greek. Having a  common language allowed ideas to be more easily expressed. Jesuss apostles gained converts in Jewish communities around the Mediterranean Sea. They established over  Christian communities by . Although most of these were in the Roman Empire notable Christian communities were also established in Armenia Iran and along the Indian Malabar Coast. The new religion was most successful in urban areas and it spread first among slaves and people of low social standing and then among aristocratic women.At first Christians continued to worship alongside Jewish believers. However twenty years after Jesuss death Sunday was being regarded as the primary day of worship.Christianity established itself as a separate religion when  preachers such as Paul of Tarsus began converting Gentiles . To solve doctrinal differences around year  the apostles gathered  in the first Church council the Council of Jerusalem. This council affirmed that Gentiles could become Christians without adopting all of the Mosaic Law.The early Christian Church was not very organized. This resulted  in diverse interpretations of Christian beliefs. To have more consistency by the end of the nd century Christian communities had developed a more structured hierarchy. The organization of the Church began to mimic that of the Empire. The churches in Antioch Alexandria and Rome were the most important. To solve problems about doctrine or policy bishops often congregated in regional synods. This happened from the beginning of the nd century. By the r century  the bishop of Rome began to be asked about problems that other bishops could not resolve. Influential theologians named Church Fathers refined the doctrine. From the year  some teachers such as Ignatius of Antioch and Irenaeus defined Catholic teaching. This was done by opposing them to opposed them to Gnosticism.Theological apologists consolidated teachings and traditons. Among them we can find Pope Clement I and Augustine of Hippo.Persecutions Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods. This was adopted from Judaism and was different from most religions in the Roman Empire.As Christians refuse to join pagan celebrations they werent able to take part in much of public life. This caused nonChristians to fear that Christians were angering the gods this meant a threat to the peace and prosperity of the Empire.Due to its secrecy Christians were accused of practising incest and cannibalism.In the rd century Christians were persecuted by order of the emperors. They hold them responsible for the Empires crises. All residents were ordered to give sacrifices or be punished. Jews were exempted as long as they paid the Jewish Tax. Estimates of the number of Christians who were executed ranges from a few hundred to . Many fled or renounced their beliefs. In spite of these persecutions evangelization efforts persisted. This led to the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in . By  Christianity had become the state religion of the Roman Empire.Late antiquity When Constantine became emperor of the Western Roman Empire in  he attributed his victory to the Christian God. Many soldiers in his army were Christians and his army was his base of power. With Licinius Eastern Roman emperor he issued the Edict of Milan which mandated toleration of all religions in the empire. The edict had little effect on the attitudes of the people. New laws were issued to codify some Christian beliefs and practices. Constantines biggest effect on Christianity was his patronage He gave land and money to the Church He offered tax exemptions to ecclesiastical property and personnel.These gifts and later ones combined made the Church the largest landowner in the West by the th century.In a reflection of their increased power in the Empire clergy began to adopt the dress of the royal household.During Constantines reign more or less half of the Christians Christian did not subscribe to the official church. Constantine feared that disunity would displease God so he eliminated some sects. To resolve other disputes Constantine began the practice of calling ecumenical councils. These councils determined  obligatory interpretations of Church doctrine.Decisions made at the Council of Nicea  about the divinity of Christ led to a schism. The new religion Arianism flourished outside the Roman Empire. Partially to distinguish themselves from Arians Catholic devotion to Mary became more important. This was the cause to further schisms.In  mainstream Christianity as opposed to Arianism became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Christianity became more associated with the Empire. This was the reason why  Christians living outside of the empire were persecuted becasuse their rulers feared they would revolt in favor of the Emperor. In  capital punishment was first used upon a Christian heretic namely Priscillian. During this period the Bible as we know it today was first officially  arranged  in Church Councils or Synods. This was done through the process of official canonization. Prior to these Councils or Synods the Bible had already reached a form that was nearly identical to its current one in  the Council of Rome first officially recognized the Biblical canon listing the accepted books of the Old and New Testament  in  the Vulgate Latin translation of the Bible was made. Other accounts list the Council of Carthage of  as the Council that finalized the Biblical canon as it is known today.The Council of Ephesus in  declared that  Jesus was both fully man and fully God. Two decades later the Council of Chalcedon solidified Roman papal primacy. This added to continuing breakdown in relations between Rome and Constantinople the seat of the Eastern Church. The Monophysite disagreements over the precise nature of the incarnation of Jesus led to the first of the various Oriental Orthodox Churches breaking away from the Catholic Church.Middle AgesEarly Middle Ages After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in  trinitarian Christianity and Arian Christianity  competed  for the conversion of the barbarian tribes. The  conversion of Clovis I pagan king of the Franks saw the beginning of a steady rise of the faith in the West.In  Saint Benedict wrote his Rule of St Benedict as a practical guide for monastic community life. Its message spread to monasteries throughout Europe. Monasteries became major conduits of civilization. They preserved craft and artistic skills and maintained intellectual culture. They functioned as  spiritual  agricultural economic and production centers. During this period the Visigoths and Lombards moved away from Arianism for Catholicism. Pope Gregory the Great reformed the ecclesiastical structures and administration. Then he launched renewed missionary efforts. Missionaries such as Augustine of Canterbury who was sent to begin the conversion of the AngloSaxons others took Christianity into northern Europe. They spread Catholicism among the Germanic and Slavic peoples. The Synod of Whitby of  was decisive for the reintegration of the Celtic Church of the British Isles into the Roman hierarchy. And in Italy the  Donation of Sutri and the  Donation of Pepin left the papacy in charge a sizable kingdom. The Donation of Constantine further consolidated  the papal position over the western part of the former Roman Empire.In the early th century Byzantine iconoclasm became a major source of conflict between the Eastern and Western parts of the Church. Byzantine emperors prohibited the creation and veneration of religious images. They saw them as violations of the Ten Commandments. Pope Gregory III vehemently disagreed. A new Empress Irene siding with the pope called for an Ecumenical Council. In  the fathers of the Second Council of Nicaea warmly received the papal delegates and his message. At the conclusion  bishops who were led by the representatives of Pope Hadrian I adopted the Popes teaching in favor of icons.The papacy acquired a new protector in the West with the coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III in  and the handing over of the keys to the Tomb of Saint Peter. This freed the pontiffs from the power of the emperor in Constantinople. However it also led to a schism because the emperors and patriarchs of Constantinople interpreted themselves as the true descendants of the Roman Empire. Pope Nicholas I had refused to recognize Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople who in turn had attacked the pope as a heretic. This was because he kept the filioque in the creed which referred to the Holy Spirit emanating from God the Father and the Son. The papacy was strengthened through this new alliance which in the long term created a new problem for the Popes. This was that in the Investiture controversy succeeding emperors sought to appoint bishops and even future popes. After the disintegration of the Carolingian Empire and repeated incursions of Islamic forces into Italy the papacy without any protection entered a phase of major weakness.High Middle Ages The Cluniac reform of monasteries that began in  placed abbots under the direct control of the pope rather than the secular control of feudal lords. This eliminated a major source of corruption and sparked a great monastic renewal. Monasteries convents and cathedrals still operated all schools and libraries. They also often functioned as credit establishments promoting economic growth. After  some older cathedral schools were divided into lower grammar schools and higher schools for advanced learning. Many of these higher schools developed into universities. It was here where notable theologians worked to explain the connection between human experience and faith. The most notable of these theologians Thomas Aquinas produced Summa Theologica which synthesized of Aristotelian thought and the Gospel. Monastic contributions to western society included the teaching of metallurgy the introduction of new crops the invention of musical notation and  the creation and preservation of literature.During the th century the EastWest schism divided Christianity  forever. It started with a dispute on whether Constantinople or Rome held jurisdiction over the church in Sicily. This led to mutual excommunications in . The Western Latin branch of Christianity has since become known as the Catholic Church. The Eastern Greek branch became known as the Orthodox Church. The Second Council of Lyon  and the Council of Florence  both failed to heal the schism. Some Eastern churches have since reunited with the Catholic Church and others claim never to have been out of communion with the pope. Officially the two churches remain in schism although excommunications were mutually lifted in .The th century saw the Investiture controversy between Emperor and Pope over the right to make church appointments. This was the  first major phase of the struggle between Church and state in medieval Europe. The Papacy were the initial victors. However  Italians divided between Guelphs and Ghibellines in factions that lasted  until the end of the Middle Ages. The dispute gradually weakened the Papacy not least by drawing it into politics.Pope Urban II started the First Crusade in  when he received an appeal from Byzantine emperor Alexius I to help repel a Turkish invasion. Urban believed that a Crusade might help bring about reconciliation with Eastern Christianity. Encouraged by reports of Muslim atrocities against Christians a series of military campaigns began in . They were known as the Crusades. They were intended to return the Holy Land to Christian control. The goal was not permanently realized. Also the Crusades left a legacy of mutual distrust between Muslims and Western and Eastern Christians. The sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade left Eastern Christians resentful. In  Pope John Paul II apologized to the Orthodox Christians for the sins of Catholics including the sacking of Constantinople in .Two new orders of architecture emerged from the Church of this era. The earlier Romanesque style combined massive walls rounded arches and ceilings of masonry. To compensate for the absence of large windows interiors were painted with scenes from the Bible and the lives of the saints. Later the Basilique SaintDenis marked a new trend in cathedral building when it utilized Gothic architecture.  In other developments the th century saw the founding of eight new monastic orders. Many of them functioned as Military Knights of the Crusades. Cistercian monk Bernard of Clairvaux had great influence over the new orders and produced reforms to ensure purity of purpose. His influence led Pope Alexander III to begin reforms that would lead to the establishment of canon law. In the following century new mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmn which brought consecrated religious life into urban settings.Catharism  grew in Languedoc in the thcentury.  The Inquisition originated during the period of struggle against this heresy. After the Cathars were accused of murdering a papal legate in  Pope Innocent III declared the Albigensian Crusade. Abuses committed during the crusade caused Innocent III to informally institute the first papal inquisition to prevent future massacres and root out the remaining Cathars. Formalized under Gregory IX this Medieval inquisition executed an average of three people per year for heresy at its height. Over time other inquisitions were launched by the Church or secular rulers. Its main objectives were to prosecute heretics to respond to the threat of Moorish invasion or for political purposes. The accused were encouraged to renounce their heresy and those who did not could be punished by penance fines imprisonment or execution by burning.A growing sense of churchstate conflicts marked the th century. To escape instability in Rome Clement V in  became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of Avignon in southern France. This period was known as the Avignon Papacy. The papacy returned to Rome in  at the urging of Catherine of Siena and others who felt the See of Peter should be in the Roman church. With the death of Pope Gregory XI later that year the papal election was disputed between supporters of Italian and Frenchbacked candidates. This led to the Western Schism. For  years separate claimants to the papal throne sat in Rome and Avignon. Efforts at resolution further complicated the issue when a third compromise pope was elected in . The matter was finally resolved in  at the Council of Constance. There  the cardinals asked all three claimants to the papal throne to resign and held a new election naming Martin V pope.Renaissance and reformsDiscoveries and missionaries In the late th and early th centuries European missionaries and explorers spread Catholicism to the Americas Asia Africa and Oceania. Pope Alexander VI in the papal bull Inter caetera awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal. Under the patronato system state authorities controlled clerical appointments and no direct contact was allowed with the Vatican. In December  the Dominican friar Antonio de Montesinos openly rebuked the Spanish authorities governing Hispaniola for their mistreatment of the American natives telling them ... you are in mortal sin ... for the cruelty and tyranny you use in dealing with these innocent people. King Ferdinand enacted the Laws of Burgos and Valladolid in response. Enforcement was lax and while some blame the Church for not doing enough while others point to the Church as the only voice raised on behalf of indigenous peoples. The issue resulted in a crisis of conscience in thcentury Spain.In  through the leadership and preaching of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan the first Catholics were baptized in what became the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia the Philippines. The following year Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico and sought to convert the Indians and to provide for their wellbeing by establishing schools and hospitals. They taught the Indians better farming methods and easier ways of weaving and making pottery. Because some people questioned whether the Indians were truly human and deserved baptism Pope Paul III in the papal bull Veritas Ipsa or Sublimis Deus  confirmed that the Indians were deserving people. Afterward the conversion effort gained momentum.  Over the next  years the missions expanded into southwestern North America. In India Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among nonChristians and a Christian community which claimed to have been established by Thomas the Apostle.European Renaissance In Europe the Renaissance marked a period of renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. It also brought a reexamination of accepted beliefs. Cathedrals and churches had long served as picture books and art galleries for millions of the uneducated.  The Church sponsored great Renaissance artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Although Church leaders were able to promote Renaissance humanism there were also conflicts between clerics and humanists. In  a well known scholar of the age Erasmus wrote The Praise of Folly a work which captured a widely held unease about corruption in the Church. The Papacy itself was questioned by conciliarism expressed in the councils of Constance and the Basel. Real reforms during these ecumenical councils and the Fifth Lateran Council were attempted several times but prevented. They were seen as necessary but did not succeed in large measure because of internal feuds ongoing conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and Saracenes and the simony and nepotism practiced in the Renaissance Church of the th and early th centuries. As a result rich powerful and worldly men like Roderigo Borgia Pope Alexander VI were able to win election to the papacy.Reformation era wars The Fifth Lateran Council issued some but only minor reforms in March . A few months later on  October  Martin Luther posted his NinetyFive Theses in public hoping to spark debate. His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences. Huldrych Zwingli John Calvin and others also criticized Catholic teachings. These challenges supported by powerful political forces in the region developed into the Protestant Reformation. During this era many people emigrated from their homes to areas which tolerated or practiced their faith.In Germany the Reformation led to war between the Protestant Schmalkaldic League and the Catholic Emperor Charles V. The first nineyear war ended in  . However continued tensions produced a far graver conflict the Thirty Years War which broke out in . In the Netherlands the wars of the CounterReformation were the Dutch Revolt and the Eighty Years War. In France a series of conflicts termed the French Wars of Religion was fought from  to  between the Huguenots and the forces of the French Catholic League. A series of popes sided with and became financial supporters of the Catholic League. This ended under Pope Clement VIII who hesitantly accepted King Henry IVs  Edict of Nantes which granted civil and religious toleration to Protestants. In  several hundred Huguenot shipwreck survivors surrendered to the Spanish in Florida believing they would be treated well. Although a Catholic minority in their party was spared all of the rest were executed for heresy with active clerical participation.England The English Reformation was based on Henry VIIIs desire for annulment of his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. It was initially more of a political and later a theological dispute. The Acts of Supremacy made the English monarch head of the English church thereby establishing the Church of England. Then beginning in  some  monasteries throughout England Wales and Ireland were dissolved and Catholic churches were confiscated.When he died in  all monasteries friaries convents of nuns and shrines were destroyed or dissolved. Mary I of England reunited the Church of England with Rome and persecuted Protestants during the Marian Persecutions. After some provocation the following monarch Elizabeth I enforced the Act of Supremacy. This prevented Catholics from becoming members of professions holding public office voting or educating their children. Executions of Catholics and dissenting Protestants under Elizabeth I who reigned much longer then surpassed the Marian persecutions and persisted under the following English monarchs. Elizabeth I also executed other Penal laws were also enacted in Ireland but were less effective than in England. In part because the Irish people associated Catholicism with nationhood and national identity they resisted persistent English efforts to eliminate the Catholic Church.Council of Trent The Council of Trent  became the drivingforce of the CounterReformation and reaffirmed central Catholic doctrines such as transubstantiation and the need for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. It also reformed many other areas of importance to the Church. It did so by improving the education of the clergy and consolidating the central jurisdiction of the Roman Curia.The criticisms of the Reformation were among factors that sparked new religious orders including the Jesuits which became the great missionary order of later years. Spiritual renewal and reform were inspired by many new saints like Teresa of Avila Francis de Sales and Philip Neri. Their writings spawned distinct schools of spirituality within the Church Oratorians Carmelites Salesian etc. Improvement to the education of the laity was another positive effect of the era. To popularize CounterReformation teachings the Church encouraged the Baroque style. Baroque religious expression was stirring and emotional created to stimulate religious fervor.Elsewhere Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier introduced the Catholic Church in Japan. Church growth came to a halt in  under the Shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi who in an effort to isolate the country from foreign influences launched a severe persecution of Christians. Japanese were forbidden to leave the country and Europeans were forbidden to enter. Despite this a minority Christian population survived into the th century when Japan opened more to outside influence and they continue to the present day.Baroque Enlightenment and revolutionsMarian devotions The Council of Trent generated a revival of religious life and Marian devotions in the Catholic Church. During the Reformation the Church had defended its Marian beliefs against Protestant views. Pope Paul V and Gregory XV ruled in  and  to be inadmissible to state that the virgin was conceived nonimmaculate. Supporting the belief that the virgin Mary in the first instance of her conception was preserved free from all stain of original sin aka Immaculate Conception Alexander VII declared in  that the soul of Mary was free from original sin. Pope Clement XI ordered the feast of the Immaculata for the whole Church in . The feast of the Rosary was introduced in  the feast of the Seven Sorrows in . The Angelus prayer was strongly supported by Pope Benedict XIII in  and by Pope Benedict XIV in . Popular Marian piety was even more colourful and varied than ever before Numerous Marian pilgrimages Marian Salve devotions new Marian litanies Marian theatre plays Marian hymns Marian processions. Marian fraternities today mostly defunct had millions of members.Enlightenment secularism The Enlightenment constituted a new challenge of the Church. Unlike the Protestant Reformation the enlightenment questioned Christianity as a whole. Generally it elevated human reason above divine revelation. It also and downgraded religious authorities such as the papacy based on it.Toward the latter part of the th century Pope Innocent XI saw increasing Turkish attacks against Europe as a threat for the Church. He built a PolishAustrian coalition for the Turkish defeat at Vienna in . Innocent X and Clement XI fought against Jansenism and Gallicanism. Both supported Conciliarism and rejected papal primacy. This weakened the Churchs ability to respond to gallicanist thinkers such as Denis Diderot who challenged fundamental doctrines of the Church.In  gallicanist King Louis XIV of France issued the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes ending a century of religious toleration. France forced Catholic theologians to support conciliarism and deny Papal infallibility. The king threatened Pope Innocent XI with a general council and a military takeover of the Papal state. The absolute French State used Gallicanism to gain control of virtually all major Church appointments as well as many of the Churchs properties. State authority over the Church became popular in other countries as well. In Belgium and Germany Gallicanism appeared in the form of Febronianism. Emperor Joseph II of Austria  practiced Josephinism. He regulated Church life appointments and massive confiscation of Church properties. The th century is also the time of the Catholic Enlightenment a multifaceted reform movement.French Revolution and the Church in France until  The anticlericalism of the French Revolution  promoted the nationalisation of church property and attempts to establish a staterun church. Large numbers of priests refused to take an oath of compliance to the National Assembly leading to the Church being outlawed and replaced by a new religion of the worship of Reason but it never gained popularity. In this period all monasteries were destroyed  priests were exiled and hundreds more were killed. When Pope Pius VI sided against the revolution in the First Coalition Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy. The yearold pope was taken as a prisoner to France in February  and soon died. To win popular support for his rule Napoleon reestablished the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of . The church lands were never returned however the priests and other religious were given salaries by the government which maintained church properties through tax revenues. Catholics were allowed to continue some of their schools. The end of the Napoleonic wars signaled by the Congress of Vienna brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States to the pope the Jesuits were restored.France remained basically Catholic. The Revolution failed to destroy the Catholic Church and Napoleons concordat of  restored its status. The return of the Bourbons in  brought back many rich nobles and landowners who supported the Church. However few new priests were trained in the  period and many left the church. The result was that the number of parish clergy plunged from  in  to  in  many of them elderly. Entire regions especially around Paris were left with few priests. On the other hand some traditional regions held fast to the faith led by local nobles and historic families. The comeback was slowvery slow in the larger cities and industrial areas. With systematic missionary work and support from Napoleon III there was a comeback. Conservative Catholics held control of the national government . However most often played secondary political roles or had to fight the assault from republicans liberals socialists and seculars.Throughout the lifetime of the Third Republic there were battles over the status of the Catholic Church. The French clergy and bishops were linked to the Monarchists. Republicans were based in the anticlerical middle class who saw the Church as a political threat to republicanism and progress. The Republicans detested the church for its political and class affiliations for them the church represented outmoded traditions superstition and monarchism. The Republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support. Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. Napoleons  Concordat continued in operation but in  the government cut off salaries to priests it disliked.The  school laws of Republican Jules Ferry set up a national system of public schools that taught strict puritanical morality but no religion. For a while privately funded Catholic schools were tolerated. Civil marriage became compulsory divorce was introduced and chaplains were removed from the army.When Leo XIII became pope in  he tried to calm ChurchState relations. In  he told French bishops not to act in a hostile manner to the State. In  he issued an encyclical advising French Catholics to rally to the Republic and defend the Church by participating in Republican politics. This attempt at improving the relationship failed. Deeprooted suspicions remained on both sides and were inflamed by the Dreyfus Affair. Catholics were for the most part antidreyfusard. The Assumptionists published antiSemitic and antirepublican articles in their journal La Croix. This infuriated Republican politicians who were eager to take revenge. Often they worked in alliance with Masonic lodges. The WaldeckRousseau Ministry  and the Combes Ministry  fought with the Vatican over the appointment of bishops. Chaplains were removed from naval and military hospitals  and soldiers were ordered not to frequent Catholic clubs . Combes as Prime Minister in  was determined to thoroughly defeat Catholicism. He closed down all parochial schools in France. Then he had parliament reject authorisation of all religious orders. This meant that all fifty four orders were dissolved and about  members immediately left France many for Spain. In  the  Concordat was abrogated Church and State were finally separated. All Church property was confiscated. Public worship was given over to associations of Catholic laymen who controlled access to churches. In practise Masses and rituals continued. The Church was badly hurt and lost half its priests. In the long run however it gained autonomyfor the State no longer had a voice in choosing bishops and Gallicanism was dead.Industrial ageFirst Vatican Council Before the council in  Pope Pius IX proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception.  The majority of Catholic Bishops supported this decision. Eight years earlier in  the Pope declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA.During First Vatican Council some  council fathers requested to add the words Immaculate Virgin to the Hail Mary. Some fathers asked to includethe dogma of the Immaculate Conception in the Creed of the Church. This was opposed by Pius IX. It was also strongly opposed by some council fathers especially from Germany. Many French Catholics wished that the Council declared Papal infallibility and the assumption of Mary dogma. In  the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility. Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a very small breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church.Social teachings The Industrial Revolution brought many concerns about the deteriorating conditions of urban workers. In  Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical Rerum novarum. It was set in context Catholic social teaching it rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions. Rerum novarum argued for the establishment of a living wage and the right of workers to form trade unions.Quadragesimo anno was issued by Pope Pius XI on  May   years after Rerum novarum. Unlike Leo who addressed mainly the condition of workers Pius XI concentrated on the ethical implications of the social and economic order. He called for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. He noted major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism.The social teachings of Pope Pius XII repeat these teachings. He applies them not only to workers and owners of capital but also to other professions and all aspects of life. Going beyond Pius XI he also defined social teachings in other areas such as medicine psychology sport television science law and education. The dominant concern was the continued rights and dignity of the individual. With the beginning of the space age at the end of his pontificate Pius XII explored the social implications of space exploration and satellites asking for a new sense of community and solidarity.Mariology Popes have always highlighted the link between the Virgin Mary as Mother of God and the full acceptance of Jesus Christ as Son of God. Since the th century they were very important for the development of mariology to explain the veneration of Mary. Before the th century Popes promulgated Marian veneration in different ways such as authorizing new Marian feast days prayers initiatives the acceptance and support of Marian congregations. Since the th century Popes begin to use encyclicals more frequently. Thus Leo XIII the Rosary Pope issued eleven Marian encyclicals. Recent Popes promulgated the veneration of the Blessed Virgin with two dogmas Pius IX the Immaculate Conception in   the Assumption of Mary in  by Pope Pius XII.Pius XII also promulgated the new feast Queenship of Mary celebrating Mary as Queen of Heaven and he introduced the first ever Marian year in  a second one was proclaimed by John Paul II. Pius IX Pius XI and Pius XII facilitated the veneration of Marian apparitions such as in Lourdes and Ftima. Later Popes such from John XXIII to Benedict XVI promoted the visit to Marian shrines Benedict XVI in  and . The Second Vatican Council highlighted the importance of Marian veneration in Lumen gentium. During the Council Paul VI proclaimed Mary to be the Mother of the Church.Anticlericalism The th century saw the rise of various politically radical and anticlerical governments. The  Calles Law separating church and state in Mexico led to the Cristero War. In it over  priests were exiled or assassinated churches desecrated services mocked nuns raped and captured priests shot. In the Soviet Union following the  Bolshevik Revolution persecution of the Church and Catholics continued well into the s. In addition to the execution and exiling of clerics monks and laymen the confiscation of religious implements and closure of churches was common. During the  Spanish Civil War the Catholic hierarchy supported Francisco Francos rebel Nationalist forces against the Popular Front government. This was due to the Republican violence directed against the Church.World War II After the Second World War began in September  the Church condemned the invasion of Poland and the following  Nazi invasions. In the Holocaust Pope Pius XII directed the Church hierarchy to help protect Jews and Gypsies from the Nazis. While Pius XII has been credited with helping to save hundreds of thousands of Jews the Church has also been accused of antisemitism. Other commentators have accused Pius of not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities. Debate over the validity of these criticisms continues to this day.PostIndustrial ageSecond Vatican Council The Catholic Church started a reformation process after the Second Vatican Council . Intended as a continuation of Vatican I under Pope John XXIII the council developed into an engine of modernisation. Its main task was double  to make the historical teachings of the Church clear to a modern world to comment on topics like the nature of the church the mission of the laity and religious freedom Other reforms decided at the Second Vatican Council were Revision of the liturgy in which vernacular languages could be used. Efforts to improve Christian unity became a priority.Catholicism todayCatholicOrthodox dialogue In June  the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew Is visited Rome. This happened on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul  June. Its scope was another personal meeting with Pope John Paul II for conversations with the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.The Patriarchs partial participation in the Eucharistic liturgy followed the program of the past visits of Patriarch Dimitrios  and Patriarch Bartholomew I himself full participation in the Liturgy of the Word joint proclamation by the Pope and by the Patriarch of the profession of faith according to the NiceneConstantinopolitan Creed in Greek and as the conclusion the final Blessing imparted by both the Pope and the Patriarch at the Altar of the Confessio.The Patriarch did not fully participate in the Liturgy of the Eucharist involving the consecration and distribution of the Eucharist itself.In accordance with the Catholic Churchs practice of including the Filioque clause when reciting the Creed in Latin but not when reciting the Creed in Greek Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI have recited the Nicene Creed jointly with Patriarchs Demetrius I and Bartholomew I in Greek without the Filioque clause.The declaration of Ravenna in  reasserted these beliefs and restated the notion that the bishop of Rome is indeed the protos although future discussions are to be held on the concrete ecclesiological exercise of papal primacy.Benedict XVI With the election of Pope Benedict XVI in  the Church largely saw a continuation of the policies of his predecessor Pope John Paul II. However there were some notable exceptions Benedict decentralized beatifications and reverted the decision of his predecessor regarding papal elections. In  he set a Church record by approving the beatification of  Spanish Martyrs. His first encyclical Deus caritas est discussed love and sex in continued opposition to several other views on sexuality.Francis Following  the resignation of Benedict Pope Francis  was elected pope . He is the current and first Jesuit pope the first pope from the Americas and the first from the Southern Hemisphere. Since his election to the papacy he has displayed a simpler and less formal approach to the office choosing to reside in the Vatican guesthouse rather than the papal residence. Catholicism

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiccups,A hiccup also spelled hiccough is sudden tightening of the diaphragm which is a muscle inside the chest and below the lungs that causes air to be pulled in. A short time after diaphragm contracts the throat suddenly closes. This closing stops the air from flowing in and results in the hic sound that gives hiccups its name. A hiccup is a reflex a kind of action happens in the body without trying. Hiccups often repeat several times per minute and end on their own after a few minutes.Sometimes a single hiccup happens or they may happen over and over a few times each minute in a series called a bout of hiccups. Hiccups are rhythmic the time between one hiccup and the next usually doesnt change much. A bout of hiccups generally ends by itself without having to doing anything to end it on purpose. Many home remedies cures are often tried to attempt to shorten how long the hiccups last because hiccups can be uncomfortable and make it hard to pay attention to other things. It is rare that medical help is necessary because it is rare that they last long enough to cause any harm.  Hiccups may be triggered started by several common human conditions such as swallowing air eating very quickly and laughing for a long time. They can also be caused by some drugs and by some diseases.The reason that people hiccup is not known for sure. A leading theory idea is that hiccups evolved to help human babies and other young mammals obtain milk more easily during breast feeding. This is related to the pattern that hiccups often happen when a bubble of air forms below the diaphragm and takes up space in the belly.References Health

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-shanked%20douc,The redshanked douc or redshanked douc langur Pygathrix nemaeus is an Old World monkey.  It is known for its colorful fur. The redshanked douc lives in forests in Vietnam and Cambodia.AppearanceThe adult redshanked douc is about cm tall and its tail is about cm long.  It weighs about kg. Redshanked doucs have black hind legs that are red from knee to ankle. They have white hips tails and forearms and reddish yellow faces.  They have red and black stripes over their eyes.  Male redshanked doucs have white scrotums red penises and white patches on their bottoms.  This makes it easy for humans to tell male and female redshanked doucs apart.Range The redshanked douc lives in Vietnam and Cambodia. They live as high as  m  feet up in the mountains.  They live in semideciduous forests and in primary and secondary rainforests. They live in the middle of to upper levels of the canopy.Reproduction Female redshanked doucs are old enough to mate at  years.  Male redshanked doucs are old enough to mate at  or  years.Redshanked doucs display before mating.  They drop their jaws wave their eyebrows and shake their heads at each other.  Scientists say the female redshanked douc always makes the first move.  She lies down on a branch and looks over her shoulder at the male.  Sometimes he comes to mate with her and sometimes he does not.The redshanked douc breeds from August to December and gives birth to one offspring after a gestation period of  to  months. They are born with their eyes wide open and hang on to their mothers instinctively. Between  and  months of age the color of the fur and face changes slowly. They have adult colors at  months.Sometimes adult redshanked doucs will feed and care for orphaned baby redshanked doucs.Diet The redshanked douc is awake during the day. It eats leaves that are high in fiber. They prefer to eat small young and tender leaves. They moreover eat fruit like figs buds petioles flowers bamboo shoots and seeds. They eat  different plant species however no animal prey. They eat peacefully together and not quarrel over food. They are known to share food with others.Behavior Redshanked doucs live in groups. They usually live in groups of  to  relatives. Each group has one or more male and about two females per male. The males tend to dominate over the females.Redshanked doucs cannot grasp things with their tails. They use their tails for balance instead. They use arms and legs to move through the forest. They follow the same routes. The adult males lead the group the females and very young doucs are in the middle and young males go last. When the doucs sense a predator or other danger they flee very quietly through the trees. They spend most of their time eating digesting their bulky food sleeping and grooming each others fur. They communicate with facial expressions and sounds. The lowpitch grow indicates threat and short and hash distress squeal.Threats As reported by the most recent assessment of IUCN Red List the redshanked douc is critically endangered. They are listed in CITES that prohibit international trade. There is no research of the population in Indochina. In Son Tra Vietnam the population is approximately  individuals. The most common reason is that they are hunted for substance use and traditional medicine. Moreover local people hunt for food pets or making glue.ReferencesOld World monkeysMammals of Asia

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism%20of%20Christianity,Since its beginning Christianity has been criticized by people in all professions and by people of all other religions. The reason for the criticism varies many Christians have followed the Bible in criticising homosexuality abortion and many other hot button issues. Also Christianity may be rejected because of lack of interest due to abuse of Christianity or some just prefer to not convert into it.Criticism of writingsBeginning with the Enlightenment in the th century people began to apply methods of text criticism they had also applied to other documents and philosophical writings.  This form of criticism uses reason rather than revelations to study texts. There are four primary types of Biblical criticism form traditional higher and lower criticism.Form criticism tries to find the earlier oral traditions on which the texts were based.Tradition criticism  studies the Bible and looks at how traditions have changed over time. Higher criticism the study of the sources and literary methods employed by the biblical authors.Lower criticism the discipline and study of the actual wording of the Bible a quest for textual purity and understanding.Conservative Christians as well as much of Orthodox Judaism  and Karaite Judaism  support the idea that the Bible is historically accurate. Moderate and liberal Christians generally think the Bible texts are historical and reliable. They do however think that certain passages should not be read literally but metaphorically.ReferencesControversies
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark%20finning,Shark finning is the act of removing fins from sharks. It is mostly done when shark is still alive. The sharks are sometimes thrown back to the ocean after removing their fins but they are still alive. since they are unable to swim properly they sink to the bottom of the ocean and die of suffocation or are eaten by other predators. Shark finning at sea helps fishing vessels in increasing their profit. It also helps to increase the number of sharks harvested as they only have to store and transport the fins which is the most profitable part of the shark the shark meat is bulky to transport. Some countries have banned this practice and require the whole shark to be brought back to port before removing the fins.Shark finning increased since  largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins. It is used in shark fin soup and traditional cures particularly in China and its territories. The International Union for Conservation of Natures Shark Specialist Group say that shark fin trade is causing a serious danger to the shark population. It estimates of the global value of the shark fin trade range from USmillion to US.billion . Shark fins are among the most expensive seafood products commonly sold at USperkg. In the United States where finning is not allowed some buyers regard the whale shark and the basking shark as trophy species and pay  to  for a fin.ReferencesFishing

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araluen%2C%20New%20South%20Wales,Araluen  is a small town  km south of Braidwood New South Wales. It is in the Southern Tablelands area of New South Wales Australia. It is in QueanbeyanPalerang Regional Council local government area. It is on the banks of Araluen Creek. The creek joins the Deua River.HistoryThe name Araluen is an Australian Aboriginal word. It is believed to mean water lily or place of the water lilies. When European settlers arrived Araluen was a wide alluvial valley. It had many billabongs covered with water lilies. No billabongs exist in the Araluen valley today. The natural shape and look of Araluen Creek and its valley were completely destroyed by uncontrolled and very destructive gold mining. This took place during the gold rush in the second half of the s.The first Europeans to explore the area were Kearns Packer and Marsh in . Andrew Badgery started farming cattle in the area in the s. The first European settler to live at Araluen was Henry Burnell. He was able to buy  acres of land. He started farming sheep and cattle in . With the help of convicts he was able to build a farm house and farm buildings.GoldGold was found at Araluen by Alexander Waddell in September . Thousands of people came to Araluen to look for gold during the gold rush. This included many Chinese gold miners. One of these miners was Quong Tart who came to Araluen when he was only nine years old. He later became a famous business man in Sydney. In the s there were more than  hotels in Araluen. The gold was alluvial gold found in the bottom of the creeks. In some places there was up to  metres of dirt and sand on top of the gold. In the s the gold miners used hydraulic sluices high pressure water hoses to wash away all the sand and dirt. Big floating dredges digging machines were put in the creek. There were  there in the s. The last dredge stopped working in .A flood in the Araluen and Braidwood area killed  people on January  . The flood destroyed the town. After the gold rush was over most people left the town. The Court House built about  is now used as a place for tourists to stay.Ben HallIn May  the bushranger Ben Hall and his gang tried to hold up the Araluen gold coach. The coach carried gold from the Araluen gold fields to Braidwood. This was a very steep road and very hard for a wagon pulled by horses to travel along. Often the only way to goods in and out of the valley was to drag them up or down on sleds. The wagons could not go very fast so this was a good spot for the bushrangers to rob the coach. The gold coach usually had a policeman with a gun sitting next to the driver. There were two more policemen on the back of the carriage. Four more policemen rode on horses in front and behind the coach. The gold was kept in a safe which was bolted to floor of the coach. The coach has been restored and is on display at the Braidwood Museum. The police were able to keep the bushrangers away from the coach but Constable Kelly was wounded in the shooting.Fruit farmsThe Araluen valley is now well known for its fruit farms and orchards. The fruit is sent to Canberra Sydney and to other countries.Arts and PoetryAustralian poet Henry Kendall  wrote a poem called Araluen. This describes the quiet and peaceful mood of the valley. It includes the words Araluen  home of dreams.... He also called his first daughter Araluen. She was named after the Araluen Creek. She died in  at the age of  months.Araluen is home to author Jackie French.In November every year the Braidwood Folk Music club have a weekend of folk music called Music at the Creek. This is held at the Majors Creek reserve near the site of the Ben Hall robbery.Araluen ZieriaThe Araluen Zieria Zieria adenophora is a small shrub about cm tall and cm wide. It is only found in one place a slope above the Araluen Creek. There are only  known plants. It has been listed as Endangered under the Australian governments Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act .

The ovipositor is formed by the union of three pairs of rear appendages.  In many species it is a piercing organ which allows the insect to put its eggs into a specific place. In some species of wasp the female drills through tree bark with her ovipositor and lays eggs in the bodies of grubs eating under the bark. However in many hymenoptera the ovipositor is used as a sting and the female does not use it for egglaying.insectsAnimal anatomy

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemming,Lemmings are small rodents. They live in or near the Arctic in tundra biomes.Life Lemmings and voles are the rats and mice of the Arctic. Lemmings have very short tails. They live underground in summer. Because the top soil freezes in the winter they cannot burrow underground then so they live under the snow during the colder months. They eat plants and roots. If they find plenty of food they will have extra large families that year.In a year with plenty of food millions of lemmings will be roaming the tundra. The owls and foxes have more food than they can eat. They will have extra babies in they years when there are so many lemmings. However the tundra does not have enough food for millions of lemmings. They rush across the tundra looking for food and are eaten by predators or starve to death.Many lemmings leave to find a new home when they run out of food and space. Soon millions of lemmings decide to follow the crowd. They go across the Arctic as a huge mass. Foxes and owls kill many of them. Some drown when trying to swim across rivers. It is often said that they fall off cliffs or even commit mass suicide but that is an urban legend created by a Disney documentary White Wilderness  in which someone actually pushed the lemmings over the edge.The lemmings that are left have enough food and space to survive.

There are lots of movements on the island the independence of Corsica and of Corsicans from France. The French government is against full independence. There is support on the island for to have more autonomy but polls show that a large majority of Corsicans are opposed to full independence. Some groups who claim to support Corsican independence have carried out a violent campaign since the s that includes bombings and a few accidental assassinations usually against piedsnoirs and other nonCorsicans or buildings of the French government. Corsican independence groups attack when they are sure there wont be a danger for victims. However not all groups for independence has nice treaties Sometimes independence groups are known to practice extortion and other intimidatory tactics similar to mafia activity in Sicily and southern Italy. NonCorsican homeowners may be threatened with the destruction of their home or they are constrict to pay a revolutionarian taxfor to help the groups in the attacks.In  Prime Minister Lionel Jospin agreed to give more autonomy to Corsica but just for stopping the violence. The propose of autonomy for Corsica would have included greater protection for the Corsican language Corsu the islands traditional language which is also considered to be a dialect of Italian. However the plans for increased autonomy were opposed by the Gaullist opposition in the French National Assembly. In a referendum on July  a narrow majority of Corsican voters opposed to the project from the government of JeanPierre Raffarin and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy that would have suppressed the two dpartements of the island and granted more autonomy to the territorial collectivity of Corsica.U Corsu language of Corsica In Corsica the official language is French but lots of people speak u corsu the language of Corsica protected by UNESCO.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical%20weather%20prediction,Numerical weather prediction is the way weather forecasts are made.  This is done using computer models of the atmosphere. Such models describe the current weather conditions and how they change over time using equations. Using the current weather conditions the equations can be solved or approximated to tell what the weather will be like in the near future. The relevant physical parameters such as pressure temperature the direction and the speed of the wind are taken to be functions of time. These are modelled with a system of partial differential equations. This is a dynamic system that is solved numerically. Most of these equations are implemented using FORTRAN. The equations are approximated. Since the number of calculations is huge supercomputers usually do them to finish before its too late.Basic ideaThe atmosphere is modelled as a fluid. The basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time. The equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics can then be used to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future.Local weather predictionThe results are usually too inaccurate to be used for predicting the weather at any place. For this reason meteorologists check the values and compare them to historical data. In other words they use the data to help produce the weather forecast.Model Output Statistics is a statistical model that was developed in the s and s. It uses regression analysis for a fully automated forecast. With it historical data is analysed automatically. One of its applications is called Direct Model Output. MOS uses both historical data and statistical modeling. Predictions beyond about six hours are unreliable. Another wellknown model is called Global Forecast System GFS which is run by the US weather service NOAA. It gives a forecast four times a day. Since the information is free the GFS is often used especially by smaller weather stations.EnsemblesThe atmosphere is a chaotic system. A small change of the input values does not necessarily lead to a small change of the output. This is due to the equations of fluid dynamics that are involved. These equations involved are solved or approximated once with the parameters that were observed. This is done several times more with parameters that are based on the observed values but which have been changed slightly. Because the computing power is limited the resolution of such a model is more coarse. Once all the calculations are finished they are compared to one another.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum%20wiring,Aluminum wiring is electrical wiring made of aluminum instead of the usual copper. It is widely and successfully used for electricity transmission and distribution. It is lighter  and stronger than copper wire which helps prevent the cables from sagging. It is also less expensive than copper wire. It has also been successfully used in aircraft wiring. In the s with the rising price of copper electricians started to use it to wire homes and other buildings. Aluminum wiring was not successful in this application and it is a major safety problem. Because of the safety problems with aluminum wiring it was discontinued for building wiring in the mids. Over time aluminum wiring can separate from the screws on electrical outlets switches or lights creating a poor connection which causes the wire to heat up. The heat can cause the aluminum to oxidize creating an even worse connection and more heat which can eventually start a fire. Incorrect repairs to aluminum wiring such as connecting aluminum wire to copper wire with twiston wire connectors can make the problem even worse. Even twiston connectors designed to connect aluminum to copper can be dangerous. The only proper way to repair aluminum wiring is to connect it to copper tails short pieces of copper wire with crimped or screwon connectors specifically designed for this purpose.MetalsElectrical wiring

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext%20Transfer%20Protocol,Hypertext Transfer Protocol often abbreviated to HTTP is a communications protocol. It is used to send and receive webpages and files on the internet. It was developed by Tim BernersLee and is now coordinated by the WC. HTTP version . is the most common used version today. It is defined in RFC .HTTP works by using a user agent to connect to a server. The user agent could be a web browser or spider. The server must be located using a URL or URI. This always contains http at the start. It normally connects to port  on a computer.A more secure version of HTTP is called HTTPS Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. This contains https at the beginning of the URL. It encrypts all the information that is sent and received. This can stop malicious users such as hackers from stealing the information and is often used on payment websites. HTTPS uses port  for communication instead of port .Request Message The request message contains the following Request line such as GET imageslogo.gif HTTP. which requests the file logo.gif from the images directory Headers such as AcceptLanguage en An empty line An optional message bodyThe request line and headers must all end with two characters a carriage return followed by a line feed often written CRLF. The empty line must consist of only CRLF and no other whitespace.

A lot of its most important work is done by two committees The Cabinet. All cabinet ministers are made Privy Councillors or Privy Counsellors as are other important politicians such as the leaders of the big political parties. Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The most senior judges in England and Wales sit on this committeeSome laws need to be made by the QueeninCouncil that is at a meeting of the Queen and the Privy Council. Some jobs are filled by the Queen in Council too. For example when the Queen appoints a new Bishop or Lord Lieutenant she announces her choice at a meeting of the Privy Council.Meetings of the Privy Council Once someone is made a member of the Privy Council they are a member for life but only members of the government are asked to meetings except for special occasions such as when a new monarch takes the Accession Oath a promise to do their best at a meeting when the Privy Council called the Accession Council In the past some kings and queens were bored by long meetings of the Privy Council so they made everyone stand instead of sitting comfortably. The tradition carries on today.Privy Council Terms Sometimes the Prime Minister shares information with other politicians on Privy Council Terms. This means that the information must stay secret.Judicial Committee of the Privy Council The Law Lords and retired Law Lords also form the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. It is the final court of appeal from British colonies an dependent territories and some commonwealth realms. These countries call it an appeal to The Queen in Council.The Commonwealth Realms  Antigua and Barbuda Bahamas Barbados Belize Cook Islands and Niue Associated States of New Zealand Grenada Jamaica St. Christopher and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Vincent and the Grenadines TuvaluThe Overseas dependent Territories  The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus Anguilla Bermuda British Virgin Islands Cayman Islands Falkland Islands Gibraltar Montserrat The Pitcairn Islands Saint Helena and dependencies Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha Turks and Caicos IslandsRepublics in the Commonwealth Four republics in the commonwealth also use the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as a court of appeal.

Devolution issues can be referred to the Judicial Committee by  certain appellate courts including the House of Lords and any court or tribunal if required to do so by the appropriate Law Officer. A Law Officer refers devolution issues that are not about current bills.Very rarely the Committee hears Appeals from the Church of Englands Court of Arches  of Canterbury and the Chancery Court of York. Appeals from Prize Courtswhich hear the value of ships and their cargo. Disputes under the House of Commons Disqualification Act about whether someone is allowed to be a Member of Parliament Appeals from the Court of Admiralty of the Cinque Ports.The committee must also report to the Queen about anything she ask.

He got his PhD in solidstate physics but soon switched to genetics after he read Erwin Schrdingers book What is LifePhage genetics At Purdue University Benzer developed the T rII system a new genetic technique. This used recombination in T bacteriophage rII mutants to map the inside structure of genes. Benzer realized that by generating many r mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different r strains he could make a detailed map of the gene much as Alfred Sturtevant had done for chromosomes.ref nameWeinerWeiner Jonathan .

The data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity as previously believed and that genes were linear.

As the field began to emerge in the s and s Benzer found himself in scientific opposition to another of the fields leading researchers Jerry Hirsch.Hirsch believed that behaviors were so complex they could not be explained as the action of single genes Benzer thought behaviors might be directed by single genes. Both researchers tried their ideas out on Drosophila. Hirsch artificially selected for behaviors of interest over many generations while Benzer used methods to isolate mutants for a particular behavior.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelycosaur,Pelycosaurs meaning basin lizards were the earliest synapsids. They were not dinosaurs or reptiles. They are an informal group meaning all synapsids except the therapsids and their descendants.These tetrapods appeared during the Pennsylvanian and went extinct at the end of the Permian period. They were the dominant land animals for some  million years and were almost wiped out by the PTr extinction event. A few survived until the lower Triassic to form the therapsids a group which led to the mammals. Because the term does not include their descendants it is not used much now.Characteristics Pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in Europe and North America although some small latesurviving forms are known from Russia and South Africa.At least two pelycosaur clades independently evolved a tall sail consisting of elongated vertebral spines the edaphosaurids and the sphenacodontids. In life this would have been covered by skin and possibly functioned as a thermoregulatory device andor a mating display. Unlike lepidosaurian reptiles pelycosaurs lacked epidermal scales.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military,The military is the group or groups of people that are given power to defend something mostly a country. They are armed so they are called the armed forces. The military protects its country by defending it from the armed forces of enemies if there is a war. The military can also be ordered by the government of the country to attack another country. The word military comes from Latin miles warrior.There are many jobs to do in a military. Some jobs are for fighting and some are for other work to support the military. Some things people do in the military are use weapons drive vehicles and repair weapons. Other people in the military learn how to fly aircraft pilot ships or repair engines. People in the military usually wear clothes called a uniform. In some places especially where there may be combat a uniform often comes in a camouflage pattern which is designed to make the person hard to see in the forest or desert.There are two ways to join the military. In many countries people join the military because they want to.  In other countries there are laws that some people have to be in the military even if they do not want to be.  This is called the draft or conscription.  It usually depends on age and physical fitness.  Old military people or former military people are called veterans.  Some are members of a military reserve force.The military of a country is usually divided into different branches organizations that do different kinds of work. These branches usually are Army land  A military force of soldiers mainly on land or driving in land vehicles. They also use helicopters. Navy sea  A military force that uses ships and boats. They also sometimes have planes. People in a navy are called sailors  Air force air  A military force that uses mainly airplane Marines  Military forces that serve on ships but are also trained to fight on land when needed. Their main job is to attack by landing on enemy beaches. They work closely with a navy but are not sailors. They may also have their own boats planes and helicopters.Some big countries even have small units which perform special actions which are very difficult. They are called special forces.There are also mercenaries soldiers who fight just for pay and have little loyalty to whomever might hire them and private military contractors PMC which are under the command of a company civilian company. The Medieval Italian condottieri were a historical example of PMCs. A warlord may have a private army which are often no more trustworthy than common gangsters or criminals.Joining up and training In most countries of the world young men and in a few countries women between  and  and of good health may be forced by the government of their country to join the military and have military training. This is called conscription. The countries that do not have conscription include Australia Bangladesh Canada France Hungary India Italy Japan Malta New Zealand Saudi Arabia Slovenia South Africa Spain and the United Kingdom. In some countries such as Argentina and United States conscription is legal but is not used at the present time.When a person wants to join the military as a volunteer they enlist. This means simply that they put their name on a list. They have to be above a certain age  or  in most countries. They have to pass physical fitness tests to show that they are well enough to do the jobs that they will have to do. They must also have good enough hearing to hear orders and good enough sight to use a rifle. New people in the military are often called recruits. They have training at a special camp sometimes called boot camp or basic training. During this training the recruits usually have very little free time. They learn to understand the orders or commands that are given by the officers to the troops. The troops are the military people in a group. They learn the right ways to obey the orders. They do a lot of exercise to improve their fitness and strength. They learn about weapons first aid and their uniforms and kit. Their kit is their equipment. Recruits also learn how to march. This is the way to walk together keeping in step. Learning to march is sometimes called drill. By the time soldiers finish boot camp they should know enough to be a helpful person in their group. The camp usually finishes with a parade in which the newly trained recruits show off their marching and other skills they have learned in front of important visitors. Once the recruits are fully trained they are ready to defend protect their country from attack or to go to war if necessary.Largest armed forces  estimate includes  Marine Corpsincludes Strategic Deterrent Forces Paramilitary National Guard etc.includes  Revolutionary Guards

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar,Simn Bolvar    was a Venezuelan military and political leader. He was born in Caracas Venezuela. He liberated many countries from Spain in South America. Those countries included Venezuela Colombia Ecuador Peru and Bolivia. For a few years he was president of Gran Colombia a country that no longer exists. The country Bolivia is named after Bolvar.Early life Simn Bolvar was born in Caracas into a very rich family that owned plantations ranches mines and many slaves who they forced to work in their businesses. His full name was Simn Jos Antonio de la Santsima Trinidad Bolvar y Palacios PonteAndrade y Blanco. He was sent to school in Spain like many children of rich families were at the time. While he was in Madrid Bolvar married Mara Teresa Rodrguez del Toro y Alaiza in . He also learned about the ideas of the Enlightenment.Revolution in Latin America White people felt ignored because Spaniards were sent by their governor and resented wealthy mixed heritage people who could buy whiteness.  The creoles started calling themselves Americans and not Spaniards to demonstrate that they wanted independence. In  Napoleon conquered Spain and made his brother Joseph Bonaparte the new king.  The colonies in Latin America rebelled because they said they were loyal to the old king Charles IV of Spain and not Napoleon.On September th  Simn Bolvar wrote a letter from Jamaica. He explained the causes and reasons why all of South America or parts of it should be independent free from Spains ruling.  Simn Bolvar was tired of how Venezuela and other countries were treated like slaves and how they were not free. He said We have been harassed by a conduct which has not only deprived us of our rights but has kept us in a sort of permanent infancy with regard to public affairs. He kept saying in the Jamaica letter why its important to be free. We are still in a position lower than slavery and therefore it is more difficult for us to rise to the enjoyment of freedom.  This means they could not even enjoy freedom.  Because successes have been partial and spasmodic we must not lose faith. We are young in the ways of almost all the arts and sciences although in a certain manner we are old in the ways of civilized society.   On May   Bolvar gathered with a group of guerrillas that wanted to defeat the Spanish army. They got supplies and they crossed hundreds of miles of plains swamps rivers etc. Many of the men died of hunger diseases and other causes on the way there. Crossing plains on August  they encountered the royalists and won the battle in Boyac on August . Bolvar then occupied Boyac Colombia. Bolvar won the fight of Carabobo in June  and then another in Caracas. A few days later and Venezuela was free of the Spanish royalists then Bolvar went South and conquered Quito. On July   Simn Bolvar and Jos de San Martn met in the Guayaquil Conference.  They were preparing to march across the Andes to Peru to defeat the Spanish royalists in August of .  San Martin resigned his powers in Peru and went back to Argentina.  Later he went to Europe.  Bolvar launched his campaign and soon he won a small but important battle at Junn.  The royalists retreated and eventually lost. Bolvar said that his people were in a position lower than slavery but many of them  owned slaves themselves. Alexandre Ption the president of Haiti said that he would help Bolvar fight if he abolished slavery as part of independence. Bolvar agreed but only because he was afraid the slaves would revolt against the slaveowners like they did in Haiti and he only freed slaves who agreed to fight in his army. Even though Ption helped him Bolvar never freed all the slaves and slavery was not abolished until the s in Colombia Venezuela and Ecuador. He is still remembered and celebrated for helping many of the Latin American countries achieve independence.  People called him El Liberator because of this. Some people hated him because they thought he was a traitor and he was going to be a dictator.Other websites  Simon BolvarReferences births deathsDeaths from tuberculosisPresidents of ColombiaPresidents of VenezuelaPresidents of BoliviaPresidents of PeruPeople with foods named after themPeople from Caracas

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray%20Fossil%20Site,The Gray Fossil Site is an Early Pliocene collection of fossils dating between . and . million years old located near the town of Gray in Washington County Tennessee. The site was discovered during road construction in May . Shortly after which local officials decided to preserve the site for research and education. The site became part of East Tennessee State University and the Gray Fossil Site  Museum was opened on the site in .Years ago the land around the Gray Fossil Site was a pond formed inside a sinkhole surrounded by a warm wet forest. The fossils found in the area explain the ancient plants and animals that lived and died in and around the sinkhole pond.As the first site of its age known from the Appalachian region the Gray Fossil Site is a unique window into the past. Research at the site has brought many surprising discoveries. These included new species of red panda rhinoceros pond turtle hickory tree and more. The site also hosts the biggest known collection of fossil tapirs.HistoryIn late May of  this fossilrich area was discovered during a Tennessee Department of Transportation road construction project on the outside of Gray TN. As it became clear that the fossils were not normal for this part of the country members of the local community began an effort to preserve the site.Many of the fossil fauna and flora of the Gray Fossil Site are closely related to modernday species in Europe and Asia including red pandas European badgers Chinese moonseed and Corylopsis. This indicates that during the Early Pliocene eastern North America maintained a biogeographic link with Eurasia.FossilsThe Gray Fossil Site preserves a collection of preserved fossils. It is the only fossil site in the Appalachian region dating near the boundary between the Miocene and Pliocene Epochs. This offers a unique window into this region at this time.FishAll of the fish fossils found at the Gray Fossil Site belong to the family Centrarchidae.Amphibians Salamanders. Several taxa have been identified including Ambystoma Desmognathus Notophthalmus and Plethodon. These are the oldest known members of their families in the Appalachian mountains a region wellknown for its modern salamander diversity.Frogs. Numerous taxa including Rana.Reptiles Alligators. Multiple wellpreserved specimens have been identified to the genus Alligator. These appear to be distinct from known alligator species. Lizards. Identified lizards include skinks anguids and helodermatids.Snakes. The most common snakes are colubrids of which multiple species have been identified. This includes the endemic fossil species Zilantophis schuberti. Viperids were also found. Turtles. These are the most diverse group of reptiles at the site including several taxa of box turtles painted turtles slider turtles snapping turtles and tortoises. Among these are two species only known from the Gray Site the musk turtle Sternotherus palaeodorus and the slider turtle Trachemys haugrudi.Birds A preliminary study in  identified several families of birds at the Gray Fossil Site the most common of which were ducks.Mammals Perissodactyls oddtoed hoofed mammalsTapirus polkensis dwarf tapir. The Gray Fossil Site has the largest tapir population of any known fossil site including fossil tapirs of all ages from very young juveniles to old adults.Teleoceras aepysoma rhinoceros. Several specimens are known including two nearly complete skeletons. In  the Gray Fossil Site rhinos were identified as a new species named the highbodied Teleoceras for their longer front legs compared to other species.Cormohipparion emslei threetoed horseArtiodactyls eventoed hoofed mammals Peccaries. Two species have been identified Mylohyus elmorei and Prosthennops serus. Pediomeryx. Camel possibly MegatylopusCarnivora Pristinailurus bristoli red panda. This was named as a new species in .

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter,A helicopter also often used chopper or heli is a kind of flying machine or aircraft. A helicopter lifts up off of the ground and moves because of its rotors. A rotor is several small wings called rotor blades that spin together around a shaft. For that reason helicopters are sometimes called rotarywing aircraft. A helicopter flies differently from an airplane. An airplane must move forward to stay in the air but because the helicopters rotor blades are always moving the helicopter can stop and stay in one place above the ground. Not needing a runway they can land in places where an airplane cannot. Helicopters can move by tilting their rotor blades which causes the aircraft to fly in the direction the blades are tilted.HistorySince around  BC the Chinese had a flying top that was used as a childrens toy. The flying top was made from bamboo and used the same method of spinning wings to fly up in the air. Later flying tops were made of feathers tied to a stick. Leonardo da Vinci first thought of a helicopter flown by a man in  and drew pictures of his ideas. It was hundreds of years later in the early th century before anyone built one that could really fly. The first practical helicopters were built by Frenchman Louis Breguet in  and by German Henrich Focke in . A Russian immigrant Igor Sikorsky built and perfected the first practical helicopter in America in .UsesHelicopters are especially useful when there are disasters when infrastructure is damaged. Food packets water medicines and clothes are dropped from the air to people on the ground who cannot be reached by road. When people are injured helicopters can carry them to hospitals faster than an ambulance on the road. Helicopters are also used by the military because they can move troops and equipment to places an airplane cannot take them. Attack helicopters act as attack aircraft carrying and shooting guns and missiles.Training helicopter is used for learning how to be a helicopter pilot. Aircraft

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defection,Defection is when a person leaves their home country in a way the home country claims to be illegal. To the first country they can be seen as traitors.It is a political label used by authoritarian countries. More broadly it involves abandoning a person cause or doctrine to which one is bound by some tie. The tie may be one of allegiance or of duty.An example of this today are North Koreans who escape the country to live in a new country such as South Korea or the United States. The North Korean government makes leaving the country without permission illegal and punishments for this are extremely harsh. Escapees who are caught usually get sent to a prison camp or are publicly put to death. There have been around  defectors from North Korea since the North Korean famine.References Politics by issueWords

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon,A cartoon is a kind of vector which is a few short lines followed by a series of drawns sometime animated in an unrealistic or semirealistic style. The word cartoon has been used in several different ways in  the world.Types of cartoonsCartoon for an artworkThe oldest meaning is a drawing that is a fullsized design for a finished artwork. The cartoon might be a drawing for a painting that was going to be put onto a wall or ceiling in fresco. The cartoon would be pinned against the wall and its design marked onto the plastered of the wall. Cartoons were also made to design tapestry. The most famous cartoons are a set by Raphael which show the Life of St Peter. The cartoons are in the Victoria  Albert Museum. The finished tapestries belong to the Vatican and were made for the Sistine Chapel.Political cartoon In the s artists such as William Hogarth often made sets of humorous funny drawings that were about political subjects such as poverty elections war and riots. The drawings were made into prints and were sold cheaply. These prints were not called cartoons at that time but they led to the idea of modern political cartoons in newspapers. Nowadays many newspapers publish a different political cartoon in the paper every day. The word cartoon was first used in this way in  in an English magazine called Punch. A political cartoon does not always show real people. Sometimes it may use a personification of a country or organization as a person an animal or a monster. For example Britain might be shown as a woman holding a baby Australia in her arms. Russia might be shown as a baby bear or a dolphin. The United States might be shown as a Bald Eagle.Comic strips Political cartoons were often drawn to show several different stages of the same story. Many of Hogarths famous political cartoons do this. From this came the idea of telling funny stories in a series of pictures. Comic strips are a type of cartoon that is published in newspapers but they are usually just called comic strips.  Some of the earliest comic strips are The Katzenjammer Kids  and Ginger Meggs . Sometimes they represent like The Beano Cathy Baby Blues Dennis the Menace Asterix Peanuts Cubitus The Smurfs Heathcliff and Garfield. Later comic strips from the s onwards show superheros such as Superman and The Phantom. Comic strips well known introduced Superman Batman Wonder Woman Hulk SpiderMan XMen Fantastic Four and others.Comic books assemble many strips in a book. The book may tell a long story longer than a newspaper would want to print or several stories. Big Seven cartoon major studio mascots creator company owner creating studios of Disneys Mickey Mouse Disneys Snow White Disneys Tinker Bell Warner Bros Bugs Bunny th Century Foxs Lucy the Mouse Paramounts Popeye and Universals Woody Woodpecker.Comic strips posted on the internet are web comics. Some use animation and sound for special effects. Like comic books they may be large and most offer a large collection of earlier strips for new readers so longer stories can be told. Many webcomics are published shown to people by independent artists.Movie Cartoons  Main article Animated cartoonFrom the beginning of the movie industry some artists began experimenting with making drawings that seemed to move. These moving drawings also became known as cartoons. They often depict animals rather than humans. They were often just for fun but sometimes particularly during World War II were used for political reasons just like the cartoons in newspapers. Walt Disney Warner Bros and th Century Fox both made classic stars famous  cartoons including Mickey Mouse universe Donald Duck universe Looney Tunes Merrie Melodies and Lucy the Mouse. Famous classic stars animated movies and cartoon characters are Felix the Cat  Mickey Mouse  Donald Duck  Goofy  Pluto  Lucy the Mouse  Betty Boop  Bugs Bunny  Daffy Duck  Porky Pig  Elmer Fudd  Tom and Jerry  Woody Woodpecker  Popeye  Mighty Mouse  Heckle and Jeckle  Deputy Dawg  Rocky and Bullwinkle  Bettgum  Winnie the Pooh  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  Cinderella  The Little Mermaid  The Lion King  The Flintstones  ScoobyDoo  The Jetsons  The Simpsons  South Park  Rapeye  SpongeBob SquarePants  Little Lulu  Casper the Friendly Ghost  Oggy and the Cockroaches  and much much more.At first movie cartoons were quite short. When a person bought a movie ticket they would see a news program two or three cartoons in black and white and a movie. Walt Disney then got the idea to tell a long story as a cartoon. The first example made was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . Movie cartoons soon became a popular type of entertainment. Modern movie cartoons are sometimes created using computer graphics rather than handdrawn cartoons. They include Toy Story  and Shrek .References PoliticsComics

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%20cocktail,A Molotov cocktail also known as a petrol bomb fire bomb or benzine torch is a simple incendiary device. It is relatively easy to make and is used by irregular paramilitary forces and by rioters. It is also used for arson.It was used for the first time in the Spanish Civil War between July  and April  but it became known as Molotov cocktails only during the Second World War.Mechanism A Molotov cocktail consists of a glass bottle partly filled with a flammable liquid. The liquid will typically be gasoline alcohol methanol or ethanol. The mouth of the bottle is closed with a cork or other type of tight sealing made of rubber glass or plastic and a cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth. The weapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately before using it lighting the rag and throwing the bottle at the target. The bottle breaks when it lands spilling the flammable liquid over the target which is then ignited by the burning rag.Many substances may be added to the basic Molotov cocktail to enhance its use as a weapon. These includeSubstances that will ignite by themselves when hitting the target for example White phosphorusSubstances that will help the liquid stick to the target for example tarAcid will help the penetration of nonflammable surfacesSubstances that will increase the explosive effect for example gunpowderMolotov cocktails are similar to napalm bombs in principle. Napalm was originally made by combining flammable naphthalene and petrol with a thickening agent palmitic acid. The latter two are the main ingredients of Molotov cocktails. When gasoline is used as the main ingredient motor oil is commonly added to help the gasoline cling to the target.Origin of name The name Molotov cocktail is derived from Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov a Soviet politician. He was the Peoples Commissar for Foreign Affairs or the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union.During the early part of World War II when Finland refused to surrender some land to the Soviet Union the Soviets invaded it. The poorly equipped and heavilyoutnumbered Finnish Army faced Red Army tanks in what came to be known as the Winter War. The army borrowed an improvised incendiary device from the  Spanish Civil War. In that conflict the Spanish Nationalists under the orders of General Francisco Franco had used the weapon against Soviet T tanks. Those tanks helped the Spanish Republicans in a failed  Soviet assault near Toledo km from Madrid.When Molotov claimed in radio broadcasts that the Soviet Union was not dropping bombs but rather delivering food to the starving Finns the Finns started to call the air bombs satirically Molotov bread baskets. Soon they responded by saluting the advancing tanks with Molotov cocktails. At first the term was used to describe only the burning mixture itself but the term was soon applied to the combination of both the bottle and its contents. This Finnish use of the hand or slingthrown explosive against Soviet tanks was repeated in the subsequent Continuation War. Molotov cocktails were eventually massproduced by the Finnish military bundled with matches to light them.These weapons saw widespread use by all sides in World War II. They were very effective against light tanks and very bad for enemy morale. The following is a firsthand description of their effects written during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in  The wellaimed bottles hit the tank. The flames spread quickly. The blast of the explosion is heard. The machine stands motionless. The crew is burned alive. The other two tanks turn around and withdraw. The Germans who took cover behind them withdraw in panic. We take leave of them with a few wellaimed shots and grenades.During the  ArabIsraeli War members of the Israeli Kibbutz Degania managed to stop a Syrian tank assault by using Molotov cocktails. They were frequently used against Soviet tanks with great efficiency in the Hungarian Revolution of .The weapon has been used against tanks effectively because of the conformation of parts of tanks particularly around the undersides and fuel tank entrances. A Molotov cocktail could blow up the fuel tank destroying the machine particularly for older before  tank models. Molotov cocktails are much more effective against gasoline engines than diesel engines tanks. This is because diesel has a high flashpoint of C  making it more difficult to ignite compared to petrol. Some Soviet tanks actually had an entry to the gas tank on the side of the vehicle which could be opened by combatants in close quarters letting out the highly flammable liquid and making destruction of the tank even easier. These tactics are effective only inside a small space where tanks cannot easily maneuver. In such conditions quickmoving enemies armed with incendiary bombs have a huge advantage.Petrol bombs were widely used throughout the Troubles in Northern Ireland in riot situations directed towards the RUC or the British Army. As well as occasional situations where they continue to be used against the PSNI and army they are frequently used in sectarian attacks on homes and businesses by both communities. Fireworks and homemade grenades known as blast bombs now commonly accompany petrol bomb attacks on the security forces.Legal concerns As such things can cause a lot of damage and actually kill people it is illegal in most countries to make or possess them. When they are used against property this usually counts as arson. When they are used against people the charges range from manslaughter to murder.Given the recent terrorism laws such things could also fall under antiterror legislation.Recent use Ukrainians were using these to fend off Russian tanks late February .Molotov cocktails were put to use recently during the riotous  civil unrest in France. Another situation with popularity for them is the Palestinian Intifada.In Sydney during the Cronulla Riots rioters carrying Molotov cocktails were apprehended when they carried open bottles in a bus. The resulting smell of petrol alerted the driver who in turn alerted the police.During the Columbine High School massacre the two gunmen built and threw several Molotov cocktails however none of them exploded. It is presumed that this was due to bottles being overfilled.ReferencesOther websites La Unidad Italiana de CarrosArtillera los T Soviticos y la Batalla de Sesea Eyewitness reporting for the Zydowska Organizacja Bojowaydowska Organizacja Bojowa Jewish Fighting Organization Other websites  A detailed technology of the Molotov cocktailIncendiary weapons
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied%20Powers%20of%20World%20War%20I,The Allied Powers of World War I were the countries who fought against the Central Powers in World War I. Major countries included the British Empire France the Russian Empire the United States Italy and Japan. Most of these countries would fight alongside each other again in World War II except that Italy and Japan would fight alongside Germany instead.The Allied Powers in Europe were already allies before the war began. Serbia was an ally of Russia and Russia was an ally of Britain and France. The war started because the AustroHungarian Empire declared war on Serbia in  which led to a chain reaction of countries declaring war on each other.At first the United States was neutral it was not part of either side. However after several acts made by Germany against the US the US declared war on Germany in  and would fight for the Allied Powers.Russias campaign against the Central Powers went very poorly. Many Russian soldiers were poorly equipped and trained many Russians were killed and poverty and starvation became worse problems than before. Many Russians blamed Czar Nicholas IIs poor leadership for Russias problems so he was overthrown and sent to exile. The Russian Provisional Government who replaced him also made many Russians upset because they promised that Russia would continue fighting the war. After the March Revolution that overthrew the Czar communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin made a deal with Germany. The deal was that he would stop the fighting between Russia and Germany if they sent him to Russia to overthrow the government. Lenins slogan for his communist government was peace land and bread. This meant that the communist government promised no more fighting in the war land redistribution so that everyone in Russia could have an equal amount of property and that food would be plentiful. After the Communist Party took over Russia in the October Revolution they fulfilled their promise to Germany and ended Russias fighting in the war.In World War II Italy would join Germany in the Axis Powers because its leader Benito Mussolini had a similar ideology to Nazism. Japan was disappointed with the end of World War I because it did not gain as much as it wanted. Japan would also join the Axis Powers because it thought it would help the Japanese Empire grow faster than if it did with the Allies.World War I

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integron,An integron is a type of transposon a mobile genetic element. It is a twopart genetic system found in bacteria and maybe more widely. It is the way antibiotic resistance is passed on so rapidly. It is found in plasmids and chromosomes. Although the first function discovered was antibiotic resistance other bacterial functions traits can be transferred by integrons.Transposons are the gene capture and expression elements which put  the small mobile elements known as gene cassettes in place and make them work. Usuallyeach cassette has only a single gene and a specificrecombination site. The cassettes carry the DNA coding  a gene for antibiotic resistance for example. Typically the DNA would code for an enzyme which cleaves cuts the antibiotic molecule up.The first part of an integron is a gene which codes for an enzyme which captures cassettes. The second is a site on the genome where the cassettes are inserted and a promoter which drives expression of cassetteassociated genes. Integron describes such structures both when no cassettes are present and when there are integrated cassettes. Cassettes can be inserted at the site they can be cut out and they can undergo horizontal gene transfer.ReferencesFurther reading Hall R.M. . Integrons. In  Encyclopedia of Genetics S. Brenner  J.H.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax%20%28programming%29,AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a technique used to make webpages faster to use. If they are programmed with AJAX they seem to react faster. They only send small bits of information to the web server. That way the whole web page does not need to reload only small parts of it.Good thingsThere is a clear separation between what the page shows the content how it looks the style and what it does the function. Programmers that change what the page does do not need to concern themselves with how the page looks.Pages done with Ajax only load small bits from the server. Most of the time they execute code on the client. This makes the program load first so it can respond faster.Ajax can be used to read XML or JSON among other file formats.ProblemsThere are also some problems with Ajax. These are among other thingsIt uses JavaScript. Some people have JavaScript disabled.Because it does not reload the full page it breaks the history function of the Web browser. The Back button does not work any more.If the network is slow there is a high latency this becomes more obvious when the whole page needs to be reloaded.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper%20rifle,A sniper rifle is a type of gun used to accurately shoot targets a long distance away. A person who uses a sniper rifle in the military is called a sniper. A sniper rifle is much more accurate than a normal rifle. Almost all sniper rifles use a sniper scope a special telescope that allows them to see targets very far away. There are two different kinds of sniper rifles bolt action rifles which fire a single shot and then the user must ready the next shot and semiautomatic semiauto rifles which fire a single shot each time the trigger is pulled and automatically ready the next shot for firing. Fully automatic rifles which fire continuously when the trigger is pulled as long as there is ammunition generally are not used though in rare instances they can be converted into a sniper rifle. In one such instance a heavy machine gun with a scope while not a true sniper rifle set the record for longest kill by a sniper for years until advances in rifle technology and sniper training allowed a sniper with a true sniper rifle to beat that record.Typically boltaction rifles have a longer range and are more accurate than semiautomatic rifles however because each round must be chambered by hand the rate of fire is slower than a semiautomatic rifle which fires as fast as the shooter can squeeze the trigger. At close ranges or in situations where a shooter must make a quick followup shot a sniper may prefer to use the semiautomatic rifle instead. Examples of bolt action sniper rifles are the M R and M. Examples of semiautomatic ones are the M Dragunov and the M Barret . caliber.Sniper rifles range in caliber the diameter or width of the bullet fired in fractions of an inch from as small as  with the . LR long rifle bullet fired by many small pistols to as large as  with the . Browning Machine Gun BMG bullet which is fired by vehicle mounted heavy machine guns. Smaller rounds like the . LR are often used at very close range with a sound suppressor commonly called a silencer to quickly and quietly break street lights or kill vermin and small animals. The round is generally too weak and has too short of a range for longer range work or shots on humansized targets. In contrast large rounds like the . BMG are fired out of very large and heavy sniper rifles that are often used for destroying light vehicles and equipment. They can fire at extreme ranges of over a mile but generally are too bulky inaccurate at short ranges and expensive for general purpose work. Sniper rifle barrels must be cleaned every day to get rid of any liquid. Not cleaning the barrel can allow to disastrous situations or even let the barrel explode upon firing.Sniper rifles of historyOn  October  during the Battle of Saratoga Timothy Murphy a rifleman in Morgans Kentucky Riflemen shot and killed General Simon Fraser of the British army. Murphy was said to have taken the shot at roughly  yards. He was using the renowned Kentucky long rifle. Fraser was leading a recon in force against the rebellious colonists at Bemis Heights in New York. As a result of Frasers death the recon failed. This had a direct impact on the overall battle leading to the British defeat. The Battle of Saratoga was considered one of the turning points of the War for Independence. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed from the bullet of the Remington . rifle.  Another example is when John F. Kennedy was assassinated.

In the  years of their participation in the championship the team has achieved four victories  the first time in Jordan was won by Damon Hill at the  Belgian Grand Prix this was the only double victory for the team with Ralf Schumacher taking second place and the following season HeinzHarald Frentzen won twice  Italian Grand Prix and  French Grand Prix. Giancarlo Fisichella took the last of his wins at the  Brazilian Grand Prix. Drivers in Jordans cars have achieved  podium finishes the first being Rubens Barrichello at the  Pacific Grand Prix and the last being Tiago Monteiro at the  US Grand Prix although it should be noted that only six drivers competed in this race. Jordan has also won  pole positions Rubens Barrichello in qualifying for the  Belgian Grand Prix and HeinzHarald Frentzen in qualifying for the  European Grand Prix. The teams best placing in the constructors standings was rd  points in the  season.Creation and Beginnings In  Eddie Jordan founded Eddie Jordan Racing first in Formula  and then in Formula . In the Formula  category Jean Alesi won the championship in a Jordandesigned car in . After several successful seasons in lower series Jordan decided to form a team in Formula .The debut in the  season turned out to be very successful for the team. Although it was not possible to win the podium the team scored  points and finished th in the constructors standings. Andrea de Cesaris Bertrand Gachot Michael Schumacher Roberto Moreno and Alessandro Zanardi rode for the team in their debut season. The next two seasons were not so successful  in  and  the team was th in the constructors standings. Jordans drivers managed to score just one point in the  season and  points the next. The team returned to its good disposal in the  season in which it was fifth in the constructors championship. The drivers scored  points for the team and Rubens Barrichello managed to get pole and bottom of the podium. He also finished fourth five times. The teams second driver Eddie Irvine did not do that well scoring only three times throughout the season. Before the next season Jordan changed engine supplier from Hart to Peugeot .The team however fared slightly worse and fell to the th position  points. This time PP failed to win but the  Canadian Grand Prix both drivers finished on the podium  Barrichello in second position Irvine in third.The team entered the next season with a new sponsor  the tobacco company Benson and Hedges which sponsored Jordan until  . Eddie Irvine left for Ferrari and was replaced by Martin Brundle who moved from Ligier . The  season Jordan once again finished th  this time with  points. The Irish team did not manage to win a place on the podium. In the  season the teams colors were changed to yellow and black such colors remained until the end of Jordans existence. The lineup has also completely changed  Brundle retired and Barrichello moved to Stewart . The new squad was formed by Giancarlo Fisichella and rookie  Ralf Schumacher . The best period in the history of the Irish team was beginning  although the team took th place in the constructors classification  points this time the drivers stood on the podium  times  once the younger of the Schumacher brothers and twice Fisichella. The following season the engines were changed to MugenHonda and the Italian who left Benetton was replaced by the  world champion British Damon Hill who joined the team from the very weak Arrows . He also won Jordans first victory  in a rainy Belgian Grand Prix mostly remembered for a huge crash at the start. Hills partner Ralf Schumacher came second in this race. It was the only double win for the team. In addition the younger Schumacher finished third at the Italian Grand Prix . Jordan finished the season in th place in the constructors standings. Before the next season Ralf Schumacher was replaced with HeinzHarald Frentzen who has been driving for the Frank Williams team so far. It turned out to be a good choice  the  season turned out to be the best in the history of the team. The German fought Mikka Hakkinen and Eddie Irvin for the world championship for a long time. He stood on the podium  times of which he won  times. Damon Hill was doing much worse this time  he scored only  points and ended his career after the season. Jordan Grand Prix with  points on his account took rd place in the constructors standings of the  season.However the  season was much worse for Jordan  despite quite good positions in qualifying and twothirds of Frentzens places the team scored just  points and only finished th in the constructors standings. The next seasons results were even worse this time the competitors in the yellow cars did not win a single podium place for the first time since . However the teams total score was slightly higher and amounted to  points which allowed it to take th place. In the  season Fisichella returned to the team. However it was getting worse  the drivers scored only  points throughout the season although it gave th place just like the previous two seasons. After the season the engine supplier was changed  instead of Honda Cosworth was chosen. Jordan began to slide slowly to the bottom. Financial problems ensued. Although the team ended the  season with a slightly greater score   points it was only enough for the th place in the constructors championship. Its also worth noting that  of these  points were scored by Fisichella after his rather lucky victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix. The next season was even weaker  Nick Heidfeld and Giorgio Pantano replaced in the last three races by Timo Glock  scored just  points which allowed only the weakest team  Minardi  to overtake for years.On February   it was announced that in the last  as it turned out later season the team will be racing debutants  Portuguese Tiago Monteiro who previously served as the test driver of the Miniardi team and Indian Narain Karthikeyan who entered Formula  from the World Series by Nissan. The results were slightly better  points but the place remained the same  . Eddie Jordan has sold the team to the Russian group Midland and from the next season the team has been transformed into MF Racing.Results Formula One constructors

It stars Clark Gable Vivien Leigh Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland. The movie tells the story of the American Civil War from the perspective view point of a young southern woman named Scarlett OHara.Story Scarlett OHara is a spoiled beautiful histrionic young Southern woman living in Georgia in the year . In this time who a woman marries is very important to the rest of her life and Scarlett loves only one man. His name is Ashley Wilkes. Unfortunately Scarlett finds out that Ashley is going to marry a woman named Melanie Hamilton his own cousin. During a barbecue at Ashleys plantation named Twelve Oaks with all the families in the area news arrives that a war between the Northern and Southern parts of the United States has begun. Before Scarlett lets Ashley marry Melanie she decides to tell him how she really feels. While the women nap to before the upcoming party that evening Scarlett slips down and waits for Ashley to come out of the meeting the men are having about the war.During the meeting Rhett Butler a rich clever Charleston South Carolina gentleman stands up to warn the men about being too sure of their victory in the war explaining that the north has the technology the rail lines the immigrants they dont have. The men take insult and Rhett leaves to let the men cool down. He decides to show himself around the house.Ashley leaves the room as well to be a good host. But before he can catch up with him Scarlett peeps out from her hiding place and waves Ashley over. He follows her into a room where they can be alone. Scarlett tells Ashley how much she loves him but Ashley has already made up his mind to marry Melanie. The wealthy and spoiled Scarlett throws a fit and because of that Ashley leaves the room. Scarlett in a frenzy picks up a vase and heaves it across the room over a couch and into the wall. The charming Rhett Butler rises from the couch startling and embarrassing Scarlett. He agrees not to tell anyone about the conversation although humorously mocking her about it all.  Before the men leave whooping at the excitement of war and declaring how theyll whip those Yankees and be back in a month Scarlett agrees to marry Charles Hamilton Melanies younger brother. She barely looks at him accepting his proposal only because she wants to get revenge on Ashley for marrying Melanie. Unfortunately Charles gets sick and dies in the war and Scarlett is left home bored with the traditions of mourning a man she didnt love.Seeing how miserable her eldest daughter is her mother allows Scarlett to go to Atlanta Georgia to stay with Melanie although Scarlett really has Ashley in mind. While there she sees Rhett Butler Clark Gable with whom she had the brief encounter with at the party. Rhett has become a privateer smuggling goods to the south past the northern naval blockade. He makes Scarlett very uncomfortable especially after Melanie offers her wedding ring to raise money for the army and Scarlett gives hers as well. Rhett respects Melanie deeply but knows that Scarletts offer of her wedding ring means nothing at all to her. But bored at wearing interminable black mourning clothes and being prevented from dancing which she loves she agrees to dance with him when he offers a large donation for The Cause for a dance with her something which her elders think she should not do since her husband had just died and she is in mourning. But when Melanie thinks it would be all right because she would only be doing this for the donation Scarlett dances with Rhett to the Virginia Reel.A few months later the battle gets close to Atlanta and as rumors of the Union Army invading Atlanta increase Melanies Aunt Pittypat a neurotic hysteric leaves the two young women alone. Scarlett goes to Melanie to tell her they ought to get out of the city as well only to find her sisterinlaw in labor with Ashleys baby conceived on his last brief leave. The doctor is too busy trying to care for the thousands of wounded Confederate soldiers so with only Scarletts inexpert help Melanie gives birth to a boy. Thinking she may die Melanie asks Scarlett if she would take care of her son. Scarlett already terrified but not wanting Melanie to see tells her not to be such a silly goose and sends her maid Prissy to find Rhett. Hes playing cards in a brothel and Prissy stands outside calling his name afraid to enter. When he finally comes to the window she tells him that Miss Melly had her baby although she takes the credit for most of it saying Miss Scarlett helped a little and Miss Scarlett wants Rhett to come because the Yankees are coming. After a loud explosion sends Prissy into hysterics Rhett finds one of the last remaining horses in Atlanta and a wagon for it to pull. Scarlett begs Rhett to take them home to Tara finally sobbing that she wants her mother. That softens Rhetts heart as does the sight of Melanie who can barely hold onto him as he lifts her from her bed and at her nearly inaudible request translated by Scarlett takes along her most prized possessions one possession each of her husbands and brothers. After loading the wagon placing Melanie in great pain from the difficult birth with her baby in the wagon bed he manages to laugh at Scarlett because shes concerned that she forgot to lock the front door.Rhett tries to outrun both the retreating Confederate Army who want the horse and the approaching Union Army. They race against the background of the great fire caused by the Confederate Army destroying the fuel depot to prevent it from falling into the enemys hands. However after escaping Atlanta Rhett stops the wagon under a bridge over which the Confederate soldiers are marching. It is pouring rain and the very weak and ill Melanie tries to protect her infant from the weather. Rhett informs Scarlett that he is leaving to join the army. She argues with him but he wont be swayed and when he asks for a kiss for a departing soldier meaning himself Scarlett slaps him instead declaring her eternal hatred for him. The three women finally reach Twelve Oaks the Wilkes family home burned to the ground. This sight makes Scarlett even more determined to get to Tara and her mother and she whips the poor tired horse in a frenzy. The horse collapses and dies. They find Tara in very bad shape her mother has died and her fathers mental state seems unstable. Scarlett famously vows to always take care of herself and her family no matter what it takes because she nor her own will ever be hungry again.After an intermission a short break used in very long movies the movie returns to Tara where Scarlett and her family are working very hard to survive. The faraway war is over now and despite Scarletts protests they share their food with returning Confederate soldiers passing through. Ashley Wilkes returns recognized from far away by Melanie who runs to greet her husband. When Scarlett realizes who it is she too starts to move towards him held back by Mammys reminder that hes Melanies husband. They continue to work the land themselves without the assistance of the slaves such a plantation required. Taras previous overseer fired by Scarletts mother for what she considered his unacceptable behavior with the local trollop has become a powerful man in the county and out of revenge raises their taxes beyond what they can afford to pay. Scarlett finds out that Rhett Butler is in jail and she plans to trick him into giving her some money to help her family. However the scheme does not go according to Scarletts plan and after leaving Rhetts jail Scarlett meets Frank Kennedy her sister Suellens intended husband. Realizing that he  has a good business which she intends to improve and save Tara Scarlett decides to marry him despite the fact that he was going to marry her own sister.Scarlett is assaulted in her carriage while driving along the road. She is not harmed because one of the former field slaves from Tara is living in a shantytown and rescues her after which she tells him to go home to Tara. But Frank and the other men decide to go clear out the  shantytown where former slaves and criminals lived after the war because they had no homes to return to and no way to feed themselves. During this act illegal under the laws imposed by the occupying Union Army Frank is killed and Ashley wounded.  Rhett known to be friends with many of the Northern soldiers uses his quick wits and concocts a plan with Melanie who trusts him and the other women who trust Melanies judgment. Soon after Scarlett again shocks the Old Guard i.e. the remaining southern Atlanta families of her class by accepting Rhett Butlers proposal. They enjoy their honeymoon in New Orleans including Scarletts obvious enjoyment of the vast amounts of delicious foods and the closeness between them at night when he soothes her as she is awakened by a repeated nightmare. Rhett promises to help rebuild Tara and they build another mansion in Atlanta. Enjoying her riches and security for the first time since the war began Scarlett becomes increasingly greedy furnishing her new mansion opulently and in Rhetts opinion tastelessly. She holds parties inviting  northern carpetbaggers while the southerners of her acquaintance remain poor and dressed in rags. But Melanie one of the most respected of all the women of Atlanta makes it clear that Scarlett and Rhett are still to be accepted in her world.When Scarlett has a baby that Rhett names Bonnie Rhett begins to see that if Bonnie is to be accepted into their own world he must change his reputation. Melanie helps by making it known that Rhett fought in the Confederate Army. After Bonnie is born Scarlett says she will have no more children and Rhett takes the news badly since in that time the only way to ensure no more pregnancies was total abstinence from sex.  Scarlett still wishes she could marry Ashley Wilkes and she sees him one day and is caught hugging him. At a party that night Rhett refuses to accompany her but forces her to go first choosing a bright red dress for her to wear. Scarlett is apprehensive but as always sails in holding her head high. But theres no need for her to worry because Melanie is as always totally loving and accepting of our dear Scarlett walking her to every guest one by one forcing them to greet her.  She even orders Ashleys sister India to leave her house when India insults Scarlets reputation. Rhett however is very angry and hurt and late that night when she sneaks downstairs to drink a glass of port before bed he violently grabs her and carries her upstairs to her bedroom. The next morning she awakes happy but her mood only lasts until he tells her hes going away and taking Bonnie with him. In London he fires the Nanny hed hired to care for Bonnie when she neglects to leave a nightlight on because of Bonnies fear of the dark and is enraged by the womans insistence that giving in to the child will make her weak Rhett tells her that Bonnie does not have a weak bone in her body. Bonnie looking like a miniature Scarlett wants to go home and her father promises they will go right away. Very possibly  his daughters nightmares remind him of her mothers on their honeymoon. But when he greets Scarlett on the enormous staircase he had carried her up the last night he was there she tells him coldly that she is pregnant with another baby. He grabs her arm and asks if its his or Ashleys.  Angry Scarlett jerks her arm away violently and falls down the stairs killing their unborn child.Scarlett and Rhett are further devastated very upset when Bonnie now their only child insists on jumping her horse. Scarlett has a flashback to her fathers fatal accident while jumping his horse and jumps up begging Rhett to stop her. But with no time to do so Bonnie falls and dies. Melanie who is summoned by Mammy to help Rhett who has locked himself in a room with Bonnies body is also very sick and pregnant with another baby despite being told she would never survive another birth. She collapses outside Rhetts door and is carried home. News reaches Scarlett and Rhett that Melanie will probably die and they hurry to see her. While Melanie and Scarlett are alone Melanie asks Scarlett to look after her husband Ashley and to never stop loving Rhett who loves Scarlett very much. She dies just after and Ashley is extremely upset.  Scarlett finally realizes how much Melanie meant to Ashley and that Scarlett could never have meant so much to him and also finally realizes that despite her jealousy and negative thoughts over the years about Melanie she was truly her best and most beloved friend. And as she finally has these revelations she also finally comes to the realization while running through the fog  home to her husband that this is her nightmare and the meaning of it is that Rhett truly is the man she loves and wants to be with.Scarlett hurries home to find Rhett and tell him how much she loves him but he tells her he wants a divorce because he feels like she never loved him. He is still very hurt by losing Bonnie his daughter and he leaves Scarlett sitting alone on the stairs alone and unwanted for the first time in her life. Then she realizes she always has Tara.  So she decides not to think about Rhett and Melanie and Ashley now and instead shell go home to Tara and think about it tomorrow.Memorable quotationsThere are many famous lines from this movie.

After his trial Willi was put into Solitary confinement. For about six months he was kept there and tortured to make him  give out the names of other White Rose members. He refused to give out names even when the Gestapo threatened to capture his family if he didnt comply. On October   Willi was brought out of his cell and straight to the guillotine. He was the last of the original members to be killed.In a heartfelt last letter to his family he saidOn this day Im leaving this life and entering eternity. What hurts me most of all is that I am causing such pain to those of you who go on living. But strength and comfort youll find with God and that is what I am praying for till the last moment. I know that it will be harder for you than for me. I ask you Father and Mother from the bottom of my heart to forgive me for the anguish and the disappointment Ive brought you. I have often regretted what Ive done to you especially here in prison. Forgive me and always pray for me Hold on to the good memories.... I could never say to you while alive how much I loved you but now in the last hours I want to tell you unfortunately only on this dry paper that I love all of you deeply and that I have respected you. For everything that you gave me and everything you made possible for me with your care and love. Hold each other and stand together with love and trust.... Gods blessing on us in Him we are and we live.... I am with love always Willi.Cause for Sainthood On November   Pope John Paul II included Willi Graf and Christoph Probst in the Martyrology of the Catholic Church.

Mestizos form the largest part of the population in some Latin American nations a large minority of mestizos makes up most of the population in Mexico which is the Spanishspeaking nation with the largest population in the world.During the colonial era many Native Americans were converted to Roman Catholicism and began using the Spanish language instead of their traditional one.

Because of this many Native Americans gained better social status by calling themselves mestizos instead of indios.IndoMestizo IndoMestizo also known as Cholo is a Spanish term for a person who is around  Native American and  Caucasian ancestry and an unfortunate derogatory term used by the European cast system for racial discrimination against Original Native people httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiCastaIndoMestizos term is a racial slur used  mostly to discriminate against Original Native people  in Eastern and Southern Mexico much of Northern Central Americain South American West Pacific Side Ecuador Peru Chile Colombia and BoliviaIndoMestizos usually have more Native American traits but may have a light pigmentation with completely Native American features or a dark pigmenation with some obvious Caucasian features.Famous IndoMestizos include Maya Zapata George Lopez and Danny Trejo.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megafauna,Megafauna are large animals. The word is most used for the Pleistocene megafauna  the large land animals of the last ice age such as mammoths. It is also used for the largest living wild land animals especially elephants giraffes hippopotamus rhinoceros elk condors etc.Its use is connected with the discussion about the Holocene extinctions after the ice age. Most of the large land animals which were alive  years ago are now extinct and there is much discussion as to what has caused this. The two main theories are hunting by humans and climate change. Together these reasons are enough to explain why these previously successful animals are now extinct. Elephant birds on Madagascar were certainly hunted to extinction as were the Moas in New Zealand.  Archaeological sites with evidence of moa hunting are all over New Zealand. The moas became extinct about five hundred years ago. The moas had survived being hunted by Haasts Eagle but they did not survive being hunted for food by the Maoris.For many others the climate changes may have been the main reason for their extinction.References

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog%20attack,When a dog attacks and bites a human this is generally known as dog attack. Dogs have been among the first animals to be domesticated and have lived with humans for a long time. Dog attacks are common in daily life. The biting dog causes an injury which may be serious and may lead to death. In addition to the bite wound the dog may transmit diseases through the bite one example for a disease transmitted through biting is rabies. There is a discussion whether certain breeds of dogs are more prone to producing an attack than others. Very often the attack is triggered by human behavior.If a dog feels threatened it will protect itself and its companionsDogs are possessive Removing something the dog considers its possession such as food or water may trigger an attack. Dogs are territorial Entering the territory of a dog may trigger an attackSince dogs have lived with humans for a long time they are good at interpreting body language. If this body language is threatening the dog may react accordingly.Dogs have many of the hunting behaviors wolves have If they consider something to be prey they may hunt it. Trained dogs may attack without warningReferences Everyday life

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis,Leishmaniasis or leishmaniosis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. It is spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies.The disease has three formsCutaneous leishmaniasis skin ulcersMucocutaneous leishmaniasis  ulcers of the skin mouth and noseVisceral leishmaniasis starts with skin ulcers then fever low red blood cells and a large spleen and liverLeishmaniasis in humans is caused by more than  species of Leishmania. Risk factors include poverty malnutrition deforestation and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by identifying the parasites under a microscope. The visceral form can be diagnosed with a blood test.Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Another way is using insecticides to kill sandflies. Early treatment of people with the disease also helps prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired the species of Leishmania and the type of infection. Medications used for the visceral form include liposomal amphotericin B a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin and miltefosine. For the cutaneous form paromomycin fluconazole or pentamidine can help.As of  about  million people are infected in some  countries. There are about  million new cases each year. Each year between  thousand and  thousand people die from the disease. About million people in Asia Africa South and Central America and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common. The World Health Organization has gotten discounts on some medications to treat the disease.The parasites that cause the disease also infect other mammals The disease has been described in dogs cats rodents cattle and horses.  In addition to the mammal the parasite needs an insect that spreads the parasite through its sting.Lifecycle of the parasite Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies. These can transmit the infection Leishmania. The sandflies inject the infective stage metacyclic promastigotes during blood meals .  Metacyclic promastigotes that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages  and transform into amastigotes .  Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues depending in part on which Leishmania species is involved .  The differences in the type of tissue affected are responsible for the different visible types of leishmaniasis. Sandflies become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes .  In the sandflys midgut the parasites differentiate into promastigotes  which multiply differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes and migrate to the proboscis .The genomes of three Leishmania species have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite. Leishmania has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment. The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for drugs and aid the development of vaccines.ReferencesDiseases spread by insects

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin%20King%20List,The Turin King List also called the Turin Royal Canon is a list of the kings of Egypt. It was written in Egyptian hieratic script on papyrus. It is thought to date from the rule of Pharaoh Ramesses II. The list is now in the Egyptian Museum  in  Turin. The papyrus is the most complete list of kings written by the Egyptians. It is the basis working out the dates of kings before the rule of Ramesses II.Creation and useThe papyrus is believed to have been written in the time of Ramesses II during the middle of the New Kingdom or the th Dynasty. The beginning and ending of the list are lost. There is no introduction and the list stops after the th Dynasty. It may have been written at any later time from Ramesses II to as late as the th Dynasty. The papyrus lists the names of rulers the lengths of their rule in years with months and days for some kings. In some cases they are grouped together by family. This grouping is almost the same as the dynasties of Manethos book. The list includes the names of kings who only ruled for a very short time or those ruling small areas that may not be in listed in other sources.The list also is believed to contain kings from the th Dynasty the Hyksos who ruled Lower Egypt and the River Nile delta. The Hyksos rulers do not have cartouches borders around the name of a king. They do have a hieroglyphic sign to show that they were foreigners.The papyrus was a tax roll but on its back is written a list of rulers of Egypt. It includes the mythical kings such as gods demigods and spirits as well as human kings. As the papyrus was reused for the tax roll it shows the list was not of great formal importance to the writer. The list is thought to have been used as an administrative aid. As such the papyrus is not supposed to be biased against certain rulers and is believed to include all the kings of Egypt up through at least the th Dynasty.Discovery and reconstructionThe papyrus was found by the Italian traveler Bernardino Drovetti in  at Luxor Thebes. In  was put in the Egyptian Museum in Turin Italy and known as Papyrus Number . When the box in which it had been taken to Italy was unpacked the list had broken up into small pieces. JeanFrancois Champollion could read only some of the larger pieces which had royal names.The Saxon researcher Gustav Seyffarth  looked carefully at some of the pieces some only one square centimeter in size. He made a more complete reconstruction of the papyrus based only on the papyrus fibers as he could not read the hieratic characters. Later work by the Munich Egyptologist Jens Peter Lauth largely agreed with Seyffarths work.In  Egyptologist Kim Ryholt published a new version of the list in his book The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c. B.C. Egyptologist Donald Redford has also studied the papyrus and has noted that many of the lists names match historic monuments and other documents. However there are some differences and not all of the names match. The list may not be completely accurate for preRamesses II chronology.About  of the papyrus is missing. It is . m long and . m wide broken into over  pieces. In  new pieces were discovered in the storage room of the Egyptian Museum of Turin in good condition. A new edition of the papyrus is expected.The name Hudjefa is listed twice in the papyrus. The name is now known to have been used by the royal scribes of Ramesses II when the name of a king was unreadable or missing.Contents of the papyrusThe papyrus is divided into eleven columns. The names and positions of several kings are still uncertain as the list is so badly damaged.Column   Gods of Ancient EgyptColumn   Rows  Spirits and mythical kingsColumn   Rows  Dynasties Column   Rows  Dynasties Column   Rows  Dynasties Column   Rows  Dynasties Column   Rows  Dynasties Column   Rows  Dynasty Column   Rows  Dynasty Column   Rows  Dynasty Column   Rows  Dynasties Column   Rows  Dynasties This is the list of kingsSecond columnThird columnFourth ColumnFifth ColumnSixth ColumnSeventh ColumnEighth ColunmNinth ColumnTenth ColumnEleventh ColumnRelated pagesList of pharaohs Abydos King List Karnak king listPalermo Stone An older fragmented king listReferencesBibliographyAlan Gardiner editor.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogue%20computer,Analogue computers are mechanical or electronic devices which solve problems. some are used to control machines. They were once the only way a machine could be controlled and are still used in cases where digital computers are not the best choice. The abacus a digital device also sometimes called a computer was used by Babylonians in c.  BC.The earliest known analogue computer in metal was the Antikythera device. However this was certainly not the first in other forms. Some people think that mental inventions count as analogue computers such as the invention of the zero Ancient Egypt  BC. But in that case almost every invention by mankind would count as an analogue computer and that is not really how the term is used.Certainly the invention of the slide rule was important for calculations. They were developed in the th century by William Oughtred after John Napiers work on logarithms. Slide rules are definitely mechanical calculating machines. They were the most commonly used tools in science and engineering before the ss.For the industrial revolution the invention of James Watts governor was critical because it was a negative feedback control for large pumps and engines. In fact most analogue computers work with continuous data rather that discrete or digital data. They are like abstract models of the real world. An analogue engine models the critical aspects of the real engine.Related pages Charles BabbageAbacusReferences ComputingEngineering

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyly,Polyphyly is a term in cladistics. It describes a group of organisms whose last common ancestor is not a member of the group. Another way of expressing this is to say that polyphyly includes groups some members of which are descended from ancestral populations.The diagrams show that birds and mammals are indeed related but only at the level of the early amniotes. In terms of evolution there is a vast gulf between them.More common in traditional taxonomy is to include all descendants say living mammals without the group they evolved from which would be some clade in the therapsida. This is done for convenience but it makes the mammals polyphyletic.Biological classification aims to group species together such that every group is descended from a single common ancestor. A polyphyletic group can be fixed either by excluding clades or by adding the common ancestor.According to cladistics it should be the aim of classification to ensure that all groups are monophyletic. However other taxonomists argue that there is a valid place for groups that are paraphyletic. These would contain their most recent common ancestor but not all the descendants of that ancestor.Notes Cladistics

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City,Ho Chi Minh City  is a city in southern Vietnam. It is governed as a municipality and includes a large rural area. It is the biggest city in Vietnam. About  million people live in the city. Before its fall on  April  the city used to be called Saigon and this is still the most common name in everyday conversation. The name Saigon come from the Saigon River which flows through the city.HistoryIt used to be a Khmer port city called Prey Nokor or Jungle City. The city was taken over by the Vietnamese and eventually took the name ofSi Gn. It was invaded by the French in . As French Saigon it was the capital of French Indochina and became an important city in French colonial trade. After independencefrom France in  to  Saigon became the capital of the Republic of Vietnam. After the end of the US campaign  in the Vietnam War Saigon was overtaken by the North Vietnamese army on  April  and renamed after H Ch Minh. The tradition of naming places in Vietnam after great people is very common. Many streets bear the names of epic heroes. Hai Ba Trung street is named after heroic sisters.Despite the name change many people from other countries and even among Vietnamese people still call the city Saigon today. Interestingly enough both the names of the Saigon River and the Saigon railway station have stayed unchanged.City categorizationHo Chi Minh City HCMC has expanded with industrialization. It now includes all of the surrounding towns. The city center is old Saigon. Old Saigon has two main districts One and Three. The new city districts used to be rice fields and fish farms. There are fish all over the city.GeographyHo Chi Minh City is as flat as the river plain it sits on. Nearly all roads are built flat. Bicycle riding around the Mekong delta is very easy in dry weather. Because of the flatness roads and buildings sink into the draining soil. Lying water keeps pollution very close to city homes. The rising tides can flood many districts when the moon is fullest. Because rainwater cant be kept in valleys or mountains the citywater is dangerous to drink. Most people drink from large bottles of water  .When the streets flood in rain or tides the dirt from drains returns onto the city. This has caused a lot of problems for the health of the people living in the city. Escaping sewer water makes people very sick in the tropical countries. Older people may avoid drinking more than a few drinks a day.EnvironmentIts very tropical in the city. The trees in streets are cut down to half every year  but they grow back. Fresh food markets are all over the city. The city has so much rain that drains and rivers surround every district.The southeast of the province has the Can Gio Wetlands. Its a  square kilometre mangrove area between Ho Chi Minh City and the sea.Inside the wetlands there are birds deer fish frogs insects lizards monkeys otters and snakes. The centipedes all around the city are very dangerous maybe deadly to tiny animals. People catch and consume the snakes.The wetlands and ecosystem has been designated as a biosphere reserve. Ho Chi Minh people get education on how to look after their biosphere reserve and wetlands.PortThe city is a river port on the Saigon River. Several larger terminals operate outside and inside of the city. Many small docks operate around the city. The river system leads out to sea at Vung Tau or onto the Mekong delta.Delivery of materials for the city can be made by boat. Farm produce distributors can arrive by boat in many districts outside the city.EducationThe use of English is rising in HCMC. Many HCMC people will travel around the world by using English as their international language. Many other languages are studied. French was previously the most popular. Chinese is also very well known to many people.InternationalThe city has international schools that teach foreign children. All classes except for languages are given in the chosen language. Many international schools have chosen English as the primary language. Some of the international schools are named by their country of origin. The schools named after a country use the national language of that country.NationalEnglish is a subject taught in all national schools.Afterschool and collegesMany HCMC parents use cram schools to improve their childrens English. HCMC adults attend colleges to learn English.Going overseasSome HCMC people will go overseas to get foreign education. It can be through staying with relatives attending boarding schools joining programs or with family.UniversitiesEnglish is taught at university in HCMC. It doesnt replace the national language at most universities. International universities might set a requirement for English or another language.Hobbies A favorite hobby is fishing. Fish invade grass fields when they flood  locals wade into the fields with good fishing rods to catch them. Kite flying is a popular hobby in the city. When the wind season starts many fields are full of kiteflyers. At this time the city skyline is dotted with kites. Ho Chi Minh City is a very busy city. The traffic makes little sense to foreigners. Motorbikes are the most common vehicle. The motorbikes mostly travel at speeds under kmhr. Cars drivers do their best to never hit motorcycles. Families ride together around the city for fun in the evening. Street food is as popular in HCMC as it is in all of SouthEast Asia.PovertyWealthy people live a fantastic life in the city. But others are very poor. Poor does not always mean without food clothing shelter or work in HCMC. The cost of living in Vietnam helps even the poorest people to survive. Many temples churches charities and government organizations help people that are even more misfortunate than the poor. But still some ultrapoor people struggle with homelessness and the tropical weather  they get very dark skin compared to other people.EntertainmentThere is a lot of entertainment for the people in the city.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader,Wader is a common term in ornithology for birds which walk about in shallow water. Sometimes they are called shorebirds. They are members of the order Charadriiformes which are water birds. The Charadriiformes also includes marinegoing seabirds with webbed feet. The evolutionary relationships of these birds are very complicated.Most waders live in wetland or coastal environments.  Many species of Arctic and temperate regions are strongly migratory but tropical birds are often resident. Some of the Arctic species such as little stint are amongst the longest distance migrants spending the nonbreeding season in the southern hemisphere.Most species eat small invertebrates picked out of mud or exposed soil. Different lengths of bills allow different species to feed in the same habitat without direct competition for food. Many waders have sensitive nerve endings at the end of their bills which let them detect prey hidden in mud or soft soil. Some larger species especially those adapted to drier habitats take larger prey like insects and small reptiles.Many of the smaller species found in coastal habitats are often called sandpipers. The smallest member of this group is the least sandpiper small adults of which can weigh as little as . grams and measure just over cm inches. The largest species is believed to be the Far Eastern curlew at about cm inches and  grams .lb although the beach thickknee is the heaviest at about kg .lb.References Charadriiformes

As jurisprudence has developed there are three main aspects with which scholarly writing engages natural law is the idea that there are unchangeable laws of nature which govern us and that our institutions ought to match this natural law analytic jurisprudence asks questions like what is law What are the criteria for legal validity or what is the relationship between law and morality are other questions that legal philosophers may engage with normative jurisprudence asks what law should be like. It overlaps with moral and political philosophy and includes questions of whether we should obey the law on what grounds lawbreakers might properly be punished the proper uses and limits of regulationModern jurisprudence and philosophy of law is dominated today primarily by Western academics. The ideas of the Western legal tradition have become so pervasive throughout the world that it is tempting to see them as universal. Historically however many philosophers from other traditions have discussed the same questions from Islamic scholars to the ancient Greeks.Related pages Constitution Constitutional economicsOther websites    Navigate to page for Encyclopedia of the Science of Law Mellen .

None has been found so far but astronomers think they do exist.They might have an icy surface of substances which are volatile on Earth such as water ammonia and methane. Ice planets consist of a global cryosphere. They are bigger versions of the small icy worlds of the Solar System like the moons Europa Enceladus and Triton the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris.Some ice worlds might have subsurface oceans warmed by internal heat or tidal forces from another nearby body. Liquid subsurface water might provide habitable conditions for life. Microorganisms can produce nutrients using specific chemicals chemosynthesis that may provide food and energy for other organisms. Some planets if conditions are right may have strong atmospheres and surface liquids like Saturns moon Titan which could be habitable for exotic forms of life.Related pages Ice giantReferences Types of planet

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugchasing,Bugchasing is trying to get HIV through sex. People who try to get HIV are called bugchasers and they are all men who have sex with men. It is not entirely understood why people try to get HIV and bugchasing actions are hard to understand. It is rare.Motivation and action  Bugchasers are men who have sex with men and purposely try to get HIV. It is not understood why this happens. There are four common explanations.First it is thought that some men become bugchasers because they fear HIV infection which had previously changed how they have sex. This can include things like men abstaining from sex entirely only having sex with one person or using sexual protection like condoms. Second some men think having HIV is sexy. This means it can feel good to think about it or that it is the ultimate taboo to overcome.Third bugchasers might think having HIV makes them part of a group.And fourth bugchasing might be an action against heteronormativity the idea that everyone is heterosexual. The idea is that bugchasers do not achieve some expectations placed on them including safe sex. There is a fifth possible reasonsuicidebut this is not clear or very helpful.Either way people only rarely call themselves bugchasers and they only try to get HIV even more rarely. This behavior does not entirely fit in with their identity. This means that bugchasing actions are rarely based on persons known to have HIV and having sex with them. Instead a lot of bugchasers have sex in ambiguous situations where they do not know if their partners have HIV. In  researchers said there was no empirical evidence that bugchasing existed they said that bugchasing as an idea and an activity existed but it was rare.NotesReferences                                       HIVAIDS

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia,Nostalgia is an emotion. It is the feeling of enjoying events from the past. People with nostalgia will often look at or use old things that they were familiar with years ago. This is because people feel more connected to those past times that they enjoyed usually because it reminds them of how long it has been since they last connected to such past times. Examples where people may have the feeling of nostalgia includes watching old TV shows using old technology that was very enjoyable and playing with toys that you played with as a child.During the early Greek times nostalgia was treated as a mental condition primarily based on extreme homesickness. In modern times however nostalgia is treated as a separate emotion. Nostalgia is often associated with positive feelings often associated with positive memories of the past. The feeling of nostalgia often helps improve the mood of the person who is experiencing nostalgia. It also makes the person feel more connected to society. It can make the person feel more aware about living life to the best. Nostalgia is also shown to help reinforce memories as well as assist with learning.ReferencesEmotions

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacouba%20Sawadogo,Yacouba Sawadogo is a farmer from Burkina Faso a country in West Africa. He has been using a traditional farming technique called Za to help soil damaged by drought. He is notable for spreading an improved soil and water conservation practice in Burkina Faso.Early LifeHe went to a religious school where the students often didnt have enough to eat. Since he was the smallest and youngest he was the one who had to go without.BackgroundThe northern parts of Burkina Faso are very dry and often have droughts. The most recent big drought in happened in the s resulting in a famine lack of food which killed a lot of people.The drought caused a lot of desertification. There were also other problems like overgrazing bad land management and overpopulation. These problems meant that a lot of land could not be used to grow food. Together with Mathieu Oudraogo another local farmer Yacouba Sawadogo tried different ways of fixing bad soil in about . He uses simple traditional things cordons pierreux lines of stones and za holes. Both Sawadogo and Oudraogo have tried to get other people to do the same things.Cordons pierreux stone linesCordons pierreux are thin lines of fistsized stones laid across fields. They catch water. When rain falls it pushes silt special dirt across top of the field. The rocks slow down the water so it soaks into the ground more. The silt also makes a good place for seeds of local plants to grow. The plants slow the water even more and their roots break up the soil so its easier for more water to soak in.Za holesZa holes are holes dug in the soil. They also catch water but in a different way. They used to only be used a little bit to make land better for growing plants. Yacouba Sawadogo had the idea to fill the holes with manure and other things to make food for the plants. The manure attracts termites whose tunnels help break up the soil even more. He also made the holes slightly bigger than the traditional ones. Za holes have been used to help cultivate trees and crops like sorghum and millet.EducationYacouba Sawadogo holds Market Days to get other people to do these things especially za holes. People come to share seeds and learn from each another.Problems with Burkina Faso GovernmentYacouba Sawadogos work with za holes helped him make a forest of about fifty acres  hectares. The nearby city of Ouahigouya took the land to make money.  Sawadogo and his family members each get one tenth of  out of the plot and dont get any other payment.Sawadogo is trying to get   American dollars to buy the land.Referencesthcentury birthsLiving peopleAgricultureBurkinab peopleYear of birth missing living people

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrotte,A garrotte is a weapon usually a handheld length of chain rope scarf wire or fishing line used to strangle a person. Garotte is normal British English spelling with single r as an alternate. Garrote with a single t is US English spelling. A Spanish version is garrote vil.Assassination weaponThe garrote has been used for centuries for silent assassination. It was widely used in th and th century India by the Thuggee cult. A garrote can be made out of many materials including slik scarves ropes cable ties fishing lines nylon and even guitar strings telephone cord and piano wire. The Indian version of the garrote often had a knot at the center to crush the larynx while applying pressure to the victims back usually by means of a foot or knee.A stick may be used to tighten the garrotte the Spanish word actually refers to the stick itself. In Spanish the term may also refer to a rope and stick used to constrict a limb as a torture device.Since World War II the garrotte has been regularly used as a weapon by soldiers as a silent means of eliminating taking out sentries and other enemy personnel. Instruction in the use of garrottes is in the training of many elite military units and special forces. A typical military garrote consists of two wooden handles attached to a length of flexible wire the wire is looped over a sentrys head and pulled taut in one motion. Soldiers of the French Foreign Legion used a particular type of doubleloop garrotte referred to as la loupe where a double coil of rope or cord is dropped around a victims neck and then pulled taut. Even if the victim pulls on one of the coils he only succeeds in tightening the other.Execution deviceThe garrote was the main device used for capital punishment in Spain for hundreds of years. Originally it was an execution where the convict was killed by hitting him with a club garrote in Spanish. This later developed into a strangulation device where the condemned was tied to a wooden stake with a loop of rope placed around his neck. A wooden stick was placed in the loop and by rotating the stick the rope was tightened until the condemned person was strangled to death. As time went on the execution method was modified in the form of a wooden chair to which the condemned was bound while the executioner tightened a metal band around hisher neck with a crank or a wheel until asphyxiation of the condemned person was accomplished.Other versions of this device incorporated a fixed metal blade or spike directed at the spinal cord to cause the breaking of the neck. Such a device can be seen in the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough the Coppola classic The Godfather and the BanderasJolie film Original Sin. The spiked version called the Catalan garrotte was used as late as . American authorities kept the garrotte for a time in the Philippines after that Spanish colony was captured in .  Its use was abolished in  Act No.  passed  September .American military authorities in Puerto Rico used the garrotte to execute at least five convicted murderers in . In a report to Congress the American military governor said that execution by the garrotte is far less inhumane and revolting than execution by hanging. However the method was replaced by hanging. Since  capital punishment has not existed under Puerto Rican law.In the Ottoman Empire execution by strangulation was reserved for very high officials and members of the ruling family. Unlike the Spanish version a bowstring was used instead of a tightening collar.The garrotte  is known to have been used in the first century BC in Rome. It is referred to in accounts of the Second Catiline Conspiracy where conspirators were strangled with a laqueus. The implement is shown in some early reliefs e.g. Rpertoire de Reliefs grecs et romains tome I p. . It was also used in the Middle Ages in Spain and Portugal. It was employed during the conquista of the Americas notably in the execution of the Inca emperor Atahualpa.During the Peninsular War of  French forces regularly used the garrotte to execute Spanish guerrilleros priests and other opponents to Napoleonic rule. Around  the earliest known metallic garrotte appeared in Spain and on  April  the garrotte was declared the sole method of executing civilians in that country.In May  the last public garrotting in Spain was performed in Barcelona. After that all executions were performed inside prisons. In  in Spain the legislature adopted a law prohibiting any member of the armed forces from being a Freemason. As a result of this edict  Freemasons were garrotted to death in Mlaga. This was one of the many issues that led to unrest that became the Spanish Civil War.The last civilian executions in Spain by garrotting were in March . Two men both convicted of killing police officers they were the last statesanctioned garrotings in Spain. In Spain the garrote was abolished in  along with the death penalty after adoption of a new constitution.In  Andorra became the last country to officially abolish the death penalty by garroting though this method had not been used there since the late th century.ReferencesWeaponsCapital punishment

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption,Adsorption is the sticking of atoms or molecules to a surface called adsorbent. The particles which get stuck on can be from a gas liquid or a dissolved solid. An example would be the way water sticks to the surface of sand grains on a beach or to particles of soil.The exact nature of the force which holds them on varies according to the nature of the surface and the adsorbed molecules. The force may be a weak physical force or weak chemical bonds but strong enough to keep the layer of molecules stuck on. Supplying more heat usually breaks the bonds and causes the adsorbed molecules to evaporate. Only free water that is not trapped inside solid particles can evaporate.References MatterPhysical chemistry

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anuket,Anuket was the first ancient Egyptian goddess of the Nile river in areas like Elephantine Island at the start of the Niles journey through Egypt and in nearby parts of Nubia. Her temple was built at the Island of Seheil. Since the god Khnum and goddess Satis were thought to be the gods of the source of the Nile Anuket was believed to be their daughter. The Egyptians believed that the two tributaries in her area of the Nile were her arms. Because tributaries move quickly she became associated with fastmoving things like arrows and the gazelle. In art she was usually shown as a gazelle or with a gazelles head and sometimes had a headdress of feathers.When the Nile started its annual flood the Festival of Anuket began. People threw coins gold jewelry and precious gifts into the river thanking Anuket for the lifegiving water. The taboo that was held in several parts of Egypt of not eating fish which were considered sacred was lifted during this time.Other websites  touregypt.net egyptianmyths.net pantheon.org Egyptian gods and goddesses

Some botanists recommend expanding the existing plant kingdom to include charophyceans and chlorophytes.Others classify Charophyceae as a class under division Charophyta with Chlorophyta remaining a distinct division. There are also other possibilities.The consensus among botanists is that charophyceans are the organisms most closely related to land plants embryophytes.Many of the complex plant traits related to sexual reproduction evolved first in charophyceans. Analysis of cpDNA chloroplast DNA shows that characteristics of plant chloroplasts also evolved first in the charophyceans before the Zygnematales diverged from the lineage that lead to Coleochaetales Charales and the land plants.Groups generally included within the Charophyceae areMesostigmatalesKlebsormidialesZygnematalesDesmidialesCharalesColeochaetalesReferences Algae

He became the Viscount of the Heismois about the same time Robert I of Normandy became Duke in . But as the viscount he witnessed a royal charter to the abbey of St. Wandrille . Like Duke Robert Roger began taking properties that belonged to the church. These included  half the town of Bernay. He took over a woodland at Crispus Fagidus which belonged to Jumiges Abbey.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboat,A lifeboat also known as a liferaft is a small stiff or inflatable boat carried for emergencies in the event of a disaster on a ship. Lifeboats are required by law to be on larger ships.When steamships became commonplace in the th century so did lifeboats. At the beginning of the th century larger ships meant that more people could travel but rules about lifeboats were often overlooked. After the RMS Titanic sank on April   people realized that bigger ships need more lifeboats. The Titanics lifeboats were only capable of carrying  people although the Titanic had  people.Because many lifeboats were needed on the decks of passenger ships this led to the use of most of the deck space being used for lifeboats which created the problem of narrow passageways. This was fixed by inflatable lifeboats being used.SafetyBoatsdeRettungsboot
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel,A flywheel is a heavy disk or wheel that is attached to a rotating shaft. Flywheels are used for storage of kinetic energy. The momentum of the flywheel causes it to not change its rotational speed easily. Because of this flywheels help to keep the shaft rotating at the same speed. This helps when the torque applied to the shaft changes often. Uneven torque can change the speed of rotation. Because the flywheel resists changes in speed it decreases the effects of uneven torque. Engines which use pistons to provide power usually have uneven torque and use flywheels to fix this problem.It takes energy to get a wheel any wheel to rotate. If there is little friction good bearings then it will keep rotating a long time. When energy is needed it can be taken from the wheel again. So it is a simple mechanical means of storing energy. The amount of energy stored is a function of the weight and the speed of rotation  making a heavier wheel rotate faster takes more energy. Another factor is the radius size because the farther from the axis a part of the wheel is the more energy it takes to make is rotate. These three factors can be represented by M mass  angular velocity and R radius. Combining the two equations below gives MR. A flywheel is not just any wheel but specifically designed to store energy. So it should be heavy andor rotate fast. For example some buses have a flywheel that is used for stopping and starting. When the bus stops e.g. for a traffic light the flywheel is connected to the wheels so the rotational energy is transferred to it so the bus will slow down while the flywheel speeds up. Then when the bus has to start driving again it is connected again and the energy is transferred back. Of course you wouldnt want to lug a heavy wheel around on a bus so it is made of a lighter material that can withstand extremely fast rotation.Mathematics of flywheels The kinetic energy of a rotating flywheel isWhere the moment of inertia of center mass is equal towhere  is the moment of inertia of the mass about the center of rotation and  omega is the angular velocity in radian units.History The flywheel has been used since ancient times the most common traditional example being the potters wheel. In the Industrial Revolution James Watt contributed to the development of the flywheel in the steam engine and his contemporary James Pickard used a flywheel.Other meanings In the world of venture capital the term flywheel is used to represent the recurrent margingenerating heart of a business.EnergyEngineering

Quarks are fundamental particles which among other properties have an electrical charge and a name e.g. up down strange. The electrical charge of a single quark is always a fraction e.g. . Quarks combine to make a hadron of integer charge for example the charges of two down quarks and one up quark combine like this      to make a neutrally charged neutron. Quarks do not appear alone they exist in groups and are held together by the strong nuclear force. The word to describe the different types of quarks is flavours. According to the current standard model there are  flavours of quarks. There are two known ways quarks can combine to give the two categories of hadrons baryons which are made of three quarks. mesons which are made of one quark and one antiquark.Hadrons are also characterized by being affected by the strong nuclear force which holds them tightly together over a short distance.

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising,Advertising is how a company encourages people to buy their products services or ideas. Advertising is one element of marketing which also includes design  research and data mining.An advertisement or ad for short is anything that draws good attention towards these things. It is usually designed by an advertising agency for a  sponsor or brand and made public by various media. Ads appear on television radio newspapers magazines and billboards in streets and cities. Advertisers use methods that attract attention.Advertisers influence our emotions by techniques that include stereotyping and targeting the audience who we are.  Emotions are influenced by our occupation beliefs personality self esteem lifestyle relationships friends how we look and what we wear.History Commercial messages and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of Pompeii and ancient Arabia. Lost and found advertising on papyrus was common in Ancient Greece and Rome. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is  present to this day in many parts of Asia Africa and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian rock art paintings that date back to  BC.Londoner Thomas J. Barratt   has been called the father of modern advertising. He worked for the Pears Soap company eventually becoming its Chairman. Barratt created an advertising campaign for the company products. It used targeted slogans images and phrases. One of his slogans Good morning. Have you used Pears soap was famous in its day and into the th century.Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the products availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores stating in  that tastes change fashions change and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat stale and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea but it is different  it hits the present taste.As the economy expanded across the world during the th century advertising grew alongside. In the United States the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mailorder advertising.Very important was the growth of mass media with mass circulation illustrated newspapers in the later th century followed by movies radio and television.Types of advertisingAdvertising happens in many different ways.  Many products are advertised on television although not all channels permit advertising. The advertisements usually appear during breaks between a television show. They are usually for products other television shows or movies and are not normally much longer than  seconds. Some radio stations have audio advertisements that play between programmes.An advertisement for a movie is called a trailer. It shows a short collection of clips from the movie and shows the date it will be released in cinemas.Advertising also takes place on websites. These may appear as banner ads or popups. They are often still images or flash animations. The owner of the website will get money when a user clicks on the advertisement. Sometimes they will get a percentage of the money if they buy a product.Billboards advertise products on highways and city streets. These may simply be freestanding billboards or may be part of street furniture such as a bus shelter.  Buses and taxis are often covered in adverts while budget airlines sometimes allow advertising inside their planes. Adverts also appear in newspapers magazines and sports programmes.  Many stadiums have adverts set around them.  Sports teams tournaments television programmes and public events may have a sponsor who is the main or sometimes only advertiser.TechniquesAdvertisers use many different techniques to get people to notice their adverts often using deliberately shocking or provocative images. Once they have managed to make people notice their advert they need to sell the product or brand. They may try to make the product look appealing however often advertisers use humor in such a way that get people to remember the brand without actually promoting the product.  Poor adverts can damage sales or spoil a brands identity.RegulationsAdvertising is often strictly regulated for instance in the United Kingdom it is illegal to advertise tobacco except in the shop where it is sold and this is also restricted.  In France it is illegal to advertise alcohol meaning that when many European football teams play in France they cannot play in their usual shirts as breweries often advertise on sports shirts.  It is also illegal to advertise on some television channels the BBC in the United Kingdom and RTE in the Republic of Ireland are not allowed to permit advertising and instead make their revenue from selling a compulsory television licence. Some countries such as Canada regulate misleading advertising and labelling to try and prevent deceptive practices and protect consumers.References
